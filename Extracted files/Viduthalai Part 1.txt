Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema .

What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema .

Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 .

Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point.

I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]['', Vetrimaaran's Vetri ( Winning ) streak continues...Pros - Heart wrenching brutal cinema . Before getting into detail it's definitely not for light hearted . Viduthalai part1 plays a major role in setting up for part 2 . This time narration wise and making wise there was slight difference from Vetri's previous works . Part 1 explores the world of Viduthalai , Police brutality , separatist and politics . Narration was slow , but that doesn't means flat . Soori as protagonist gave a realistic show stealing performance . VJS had less screentime but created quite impact . Other cast did their part really well , they had enough scope throughout the movie , even GVM played his part neatly . Technical wise , impressive cinematography especially opening single shot sequence one of the best in kollywood , opening shot clearly established the tone of the movie . In a slow burner movie , Climax was total bang , action set pieces were well choreographed , excellently captured and edited . Ilaiyaraaja's back ground scores were well suited to this dark tone and periodic movie , songs were really great . Atlast part 2 glimpse literally increased the hype .Cons - Asusual dubbing was poor as expected , lip syncing were totally odd in most of the places . Editing in few places weren't upto the mark .Overall , a slow burning crime drama . Definitely worthy one for your patience and time . Highly recommended . Strictly 18+ .I hope Part 2 will be released as soon as possible ., I don't believe in oscars as long as the gems provided by Vetrimaran sir goes unnoticed by many.This movie should be pan India to show what can a movie can make you experience. Such a gem.Every detail to character presentation starting from the constable to the antagonist, every detail suspense even the climax is to the point. I can't deny it's a masterpiece.The acting of everyone is top notch and the rawness of the reality what makes the movie a true best. Everything about it so special, if I say anything more I'll give you spoilers.If you haven't watched it till now reading this just go., "viduthalai: part 1" Vetrimaaran is one of the best filmmaker in the country.Such an amazing movie. What an amazing performance by all the actors. Such raw, natural and effective story telling by Vetrimaaran. Soori and Bhavani Sri, what an amazing pair on screen. One of the best romantic tracks seen in recent times. Amazing production design and cinematography. The single take in the beginning was so amazing. Ilayarajas music was so nice, his classic style. I need not say how amazing writer Vetrimaaran is, the movie has such emotional and standout scenes that i can watch again and again. Waiting for part 2.There are few issues in the lip synch, which is very evident in some scenes, but i don't care, that shouldn't make you miss this amazing movie., This was filmmaking masterclass*, another reminder for why the Writing &gt; everything else to make a good movie. It was also raw, in-your-face, hard hitting - everything you expect a Vetrimaaran movie to be.Story - Loved how this socio-political topic was written without getting too preachy, it felt more like a thriller; police brutality portrayed with a lot of thought.Soori, B. V. (Before Viduthalai) - The comedian, Parotta Soori.Soori A. V. (After Viduthalai) - The actor who can do pretty much anything he's given. You've never seen this type of work from him, he was amazing. So were Bhavani Sre, Chetan, and the rest of the supporting cast. I wonder if Santhanam would have ever considered something like this.Cinematography - Very well done. Single shots. Drone shots. Shots on a gimbal, this has got everything. The camera work will catch your attention from the very first scene, you'll see why. Shoutout to all the technicians, it must have been tough to film it in those locations. Music - I didn't feel it, but it fight the 80s feel, so I guess that was the point behind choosing Ilayaraja...?The dialogues (*minus the dubbing) in this film need a special mention - especially the ones towards the end. Some of the most hard-hitting dialogues aren't even in part-1. Of course, I know that because there's almost a trailer of sorts for part-2. Not a post credit scene, almost a proper trailer. Never seen it done that way. TThis isn't your family entertainer commercial flick, but I totally enjoyed it. His one is 2h 36m long, I'd have sat for another 3 hours if I had a chance to finish watching P2, back-to-back. Can't wait; hopefully this drops sooner than Vada Chennai 2., Another world class movie by Vetri. The romance track is little longer than needed, it felt but when we see the last 30-40 minutes it makes sense why he had spend that much time. Wow ... Is that Soori? He fits perfectly to the story line and even romance sequences did not feel odd.If i don't talk about the background score, i am not xx's kid 😊 Not a noise in background but it flows with the scene. Only Karthik Raja can come close to it. Both the songs were good, listened to it on the screen for the first time!Part-2 will be for sure more engaging &amp; powerful, no doubt. Vijay Sethupathi full naked in 2nd. No discrimination for Vetri most women nude sequence in first part and in second Vijay 😂, Long after time , engaging flim, moves you to the edge of seat yours eyes don't move away from screen, the rise of soori was a different move even a small character has added plus to the movie, cinematography was good, moved away from the clashes of the metropolitan ,finally the movie is for people, movie of people, includes the officials, the base study and the work done by the director was must have great effort, salute, the acting aspiration of soori came well on the screen, the music is smoothly moves with the movies, the movie satisfied the time spent and leaves a good message to the society,, For a movie that is nearly three hours and only tells half the story, Viduthalai is still such a brilliant film in every aspect (except maybe dubbing and a bit of editing to cover that). The way it slowly unravels its world and the characters and even the way it holds back some of the harsher stuff initially to present the horridness of it through the characters you grow to love makes the drama extremely powerful. My blood was literally boiling by the end of the movie and it's not just a passing phrase when I say I can't wait for the second part, I literally need to watch the second part asap., I would say, this is not Vetrimaran's best. But it is still up there, in the top echelons of Thamizh movies.Acting was superlative across the board - Soori, VJS, Bhavani, and the host of characters that play the different parts in this movie. I couldnt think of anyone who did a lesser job. With VM around, its virtually impossible for an actor in movie to deliver less.Story is layered. There are many nuances, or two sides that compete to be right. But it screenplay and direction that makes all this come together beautifully. The movie was slow, purposefully because it it was meant to play on your mind. It was not dragging.Only thing about the songs, i wish Ilaiyaraja would control his exuberance to sing!!I also think VM made some compromises in some shots. The opening sequence was good, but could have been better. The art direction too could have been better here. But thru' the rest of the movie camera, sets etc were super.Cant wait for part-2... when the movie was ending, for a moment, i thought part-2 was going to start..... oh man., Viduthalai-The movie started with the stunning 10 minutes single shot train sequence scene which gave me a resemblance of 1917 Velraj done his job very perfectly in his Camera works. Somebody might tell that the movie pace is very slow but to narrate a story like this it is the perfect way. Soori done a great job as an actor we have seen him as comedy actor and enjoyed his every movies but this the carrier best movie for soori. Maestro's background score leveled up the movie and I loved the 2 song which have'nt affected the movie's pace. Vjs performance for his minimal screen presence very nice. Seat edge climax show. Loved the movie so much. Waiting for Part2....., Balumahendra made uncompromising raw and realistic films. Both Bala and Vetrimaaran are his disciples and Balumahendra's influence is heavyset on both these directors. Both the disciples haven't swayed till date and carved an unique raw, cruel, brutal genre for themselves albeit an unpalatable one for a larger part of the audience, which contributes to the reason why one of the top directors that India has ever produced arent as well known as they should have been.Vetrimaaran directorial debut was in 2007 with Dhanush Polladhavan, the movie was remade in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Sinhalese. Viduthalai is his 6th movie as a director in his 16th year. Four years later in 2011 came his second movie, Aadukalam which was again with Dhanush, the movie raked 6 National Awards including Best Screenplay and Director. Another 4 years later came his third movie Visaranai, which bagged 3 National Awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. He joined hands again with Dhanush for his 4th film in Vada Chennai which was released in 2018, the movie will be a cult classic in years to come and is rated 8.4 on IMDB. His 5th film was released one year later in 2019, again with Dhanush. Asuran won two national awards including Best Feature Film in Tamil. Dhanush won both National Awards for Best Actor for Aadukalam and Asuran.Viduthalai is a 2 part movie and Vetrimaaran takes his time to set the plot. Soori, an accomplished comedian in the Tamil film industry makes his debut in a lead role and is an incredible casting choice for the role. Set in 1987 in a fictional town, the plot is based on Jeyamohan's short story Thunaivan. The narration is fresh, raw and aptly supported by Velraj's cinematography and IRs BGM, both the full songs are soothing melodies from the 80 year old maestro and apt to the situation. This is Vetrimaaran's first collaboration with his mentor's one and only favourite music director. Buzzing insect noises form a part of the BGM giving you a feel that you are actually there at the mountainous forest surrounded village. Vijay Sethupathi sizzles and scorches the screen with his brief screen time. Bhavani Sre delivers an award winning performance. GV Menon is his usual clinical self as a top cop. There are several new comers in the film who all give a seasoned performance. Vidathu Karuppu Chetan as the cruel cop stood out tall. Stand out casting choice was Rajeev Menon as the chief secretary, the characterisation was so real that Rajeev could actually walk into any government and do the job immediately.If you watch movies for entertainment only, this is not the movie for you like Visaranai or Jai Bhim. The police station scenes are brutal and raw unlike any movies that you would have seen. It even makes Schindlers list concentration camp scenes palatable when compared against this.Once in a life time role for Soori and he has given his 200%. Vetrimaaran's direction prowess can be seen throughout the movie, spectacular location choice and art work supported by solid actor's performance, editing, cinematography and music makes this a grand teamwork., The first single shot is more than enough for this masterpiece that gives u a promise of an national or Oscar-worthy material,the detailing in every frame shows the behind on-screen craftsman vetrimaaran undoubtedly the legend of Tamil cinema this flick ranks next to "VISARANAI'' in my list of his filmography...He is so adamant and dared to expose such brutality and injustice done to the set of society people...able to bring out such a painful movie clear from a censor is a monstrous task....theirs gonna be a lot of goose bumps moments in the later upcoming part...
Soori is the right choice has lived up to the role that u can't think of others to fit into shoes...take a bow to his hard work...
Vjs has a lot of work to do only on second part but his entry will sure raise the standard of tamil cinema down Bollywood and will be a tALK OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA in the days to come....
In one word speechless., Viduthalai, by Vetri Maaran, who has helmed movies like Asuran, Vada Chennai is back with another hard hitting story exposing the reality of police brutality.The filmmaker weaves his stories in a way that they are niche in nature but global in approach. The movie is all about police brutality, who in the name of investigation, tortures and kills the innocent people of the village to forcefully get a confession. Soori as Kumaresan is what carries the film and reflects on some police being faithful and honest to their work, just what they are expected to be. He was too damn good in this socio-political thriller.The movie has been broken down into 2 parts, probably the second part will focus on Kumaresan's change from an innocent policeman to someone who will fight against injustice with as much as violence required. With the first part dropping us straight into an unfamiliar terrain and with the battle lines drawn up clearly, we've been primed for innocence to make way for full-blown implosion in the next chapter.My Rating : 8/10., One of the best one i have witnessed and this would be the best of vetris creation. He has given all the best but this one will be special. What a movie, i cant express this in words, a calm soothing intense simple and elegant. Thats wat vetris beauty lies in. Beauty lies in simplicity. An osm craft of art work. A huge kudos to vetri and his team. I witnessed claps for a director ever first time tats vetrimaran. He should do more movies as such and cant wait for part2. He has become an inspiration in movies and a huge fan of his work. Vetri as the name suggests. Soori omg , he just killed with his performances. With vetri he can make the walls speak. No one can do better than soori, he is an osm actor. He deserves a national award for this movie, the efforts and acting skill is top notch. VJS as well as comes in few scenes and the few one are worthy to come in watch out for, he just laid off with vetri. The camera lighting is soo good too. A simple story with a much elegant and intense screenplay. A special kudos to bhavani sree, she also played her role to perfect. Vetris writing is so strong which is clearly seen in the outcome. The best one. BGM is ok not so good but the songs are top notch, ilayaraja as always. Overall a must watch movie, i wud say u will become a fan of soori and vetri after watching this film. The emotions is inevitable and the pain he portrays kills it. Its a vetri for vetri. Please do watch in theaters, cant wait for part 2., Since it is the first part, many questions remain unanswered when the viewer finishes the movie. However, the way the movie poses these questions makes it worth watching. It delicately portrays the balance between the police and the People's Liberation Army, highlighting how marginalized communities and commoners are suppressed amidst the fight of two giants, emphasizing that war is not the solution.The best thing about this movie is that it is presented through the perspective of a low-level staff member, Kumarassen (played by Suri), who has a good heart but lacks the power to effect significant change himself. The film also provides glimpses of how things become murkier and more chaotic when an actual war breaks out. Setupati shines in his role as Comrade Perumal, and it's interesting to see his diverse choices of roles in movies like "Vikram Vedha," "Farzi," and this one."It's a raw movie with minimal aesthetics and a lot of bloodshed, but I believe it aims to reach the core of your being and show the fancy popcorn viewers or keyboard warriors how war actually unfolds and why ranting on Twitter is sometimes unjustified." Overall, it is a well-crafted movie, and I am definitely looking forward to the second part., Great content with great screenplay and very gutsy actors that gave a great performance.Soori proved himself as a great actor with a new face, Chetan impressed me in his very negative role with a very convincing acting. Both of them took a place in my heart. VJS as usual gave his best as Perumal Vaathiyar. Bhavani Sre, a new but surprising actress showed her worth in Tamil cinema. All the actors were great.Cinematography by Velraj, music by Ilaiyaraja, production by Elfred Kumar and direction by Vetrimaaran ( and story by Jeyamohan ), what else do we need?Although the movie was slow in moments, Vetrimaaran use those moments to reflect perfectly the characters and situation.Hats off to mainly Vetrimaaran sir and thanks again!, Visaranai and Asuran are ones amongst my favourite films. As such, I was really hoping for another display of directorial brilliancy in Viduthalai, which the first ten minutes detailing the aftermath of a train bombing only heightening these hopes.However, the story is incredibly average, following the predictable template of a well-intentioned "terrorist" organisation against a corrupt, bestial government organisation (in this case, the police). However, this was not the issue, as an unoriginal story can be the basis for a great film (as we saw with Karnan, and Asuran).I'll start with the positives:
1) The love story, though sometimes occupying unnecessary screen time, is presented nicely.2) Soori's acting is restrained and adept, accompanied with good performances from the supporting cast.3) The world building was quite good.Negatives:
1) The music. I never expected this from Ilayaraja, but he's definitely fallen off. The music ruined the opening single shot sequence, and overall didn't suit neither the story, nor the raw and rustic directorial style of Vetrimaaran; in fact, it removed this "rawness" native to Vetrimaaran movies, which made the film irritating to watch.2) The violence depicted on screen is a gratituous fetishisation of police brutality, and it didn't have the same impact as Visaranai. Rather, it was boring and annoying.3) The ending. It ends quite hastily (yes, it's a part 1, even then, it must work as a movie itself). There is no payoff.My only reason to view part 2 is to hope it redeems this underwhelming story., When conflict arises between a police company and a rebel group, a young constable is forced to choose between his own ideals and loyalty to his profession. This is the basic premise. However it is much more than that.A brutal and honest take on police brutality, what makes Viduthalai special is its willingness to show the truth in all its glory with as little censorship as possible . The background score by raja sir also enhances every scene beyond comprehension.Last but not the least, the actors and their characters, Soori who is able to beautifully portray the character of "Kumaresan" a naive individual who soon learns that the world is not just black and white, Bhavani Sre who portrays the Character of "Tamizharasi" an innocent village girl forced to go through horrific experiences due to the cruelty of the world around her and ofcourse Vijay Sethupathi who plays the character of "Perumal" and is able to pull the audience due to his infectious charisma .Overall , Viduthalai is a must watch if you are over 18 years of age. However ,it is best if children avoid it as it is not for the faint hearted. Viewer discretion adviced., The film was not bad and not impressive too. Can't number the many times we've seen stories like this where one policeman is trying to make a difference in the lives of the brutalized people while facing a rebel group. The story was more like a documentary, just informing us about the atrocities taking place in that villageDELICIOUS-The cinematography was imply spectacular. R Velraj's quality is improving more and more. He captured the most unusual narrowest shots giving us a real close-up feeling of what it was like being in the characters' shoes-Soori's character was originally designed being a stubborn police officer, willing to lose his career and life life for humanity sake. The chase scene at the end where he's dressed as a civilian with no gun was quite symbolic to underline his empathy for the common man-There was a great emphasis placed on the dangers of media, warning us never to believe everything we see or hearBLAND-Acting overall was casual, nothing extraordinary. You'd think Soori taking the lead will give him wings to perform in an impressive way, but nope-The movie basically gave us a tale of rebel groups fighting to retain their land and resources while the government was pushing for foreign mining corporations to break ground. Soori's voiceover throughout the movie added more to the documentary effect. There was no major dramatic effect or suspense to keep us glued to our seats., Viduthaalai PT.1,is something different and raw as much. The combo of Soori - Sethupathy - maaran - raja is way more great together.Quietly a genre which I scared of watch but viduthaalai made me feel hyped after watching this. And director Vetri maaran have to deserve something huge for the film.Raja sir's music is perfect for sure and 'Kaathumalli' &amp; 'Onnoda nadantha' are the best for add on to the playlist.Apart from these all there was a disclaimer too. Please watch this film with your own risk (bc of the disturbing scenes)Finally, hopes are ahead to the second part 🤞🏼#viduthaalaipt2., When Vetrimaaran made Visaranai back in 2014, police brutality was still relatively unexplored, and therefore, the scenes depicting them were unsettling to watch. Almost a decade later, when the same director makes Viduthalai (a two-parter) with police brutality at its forefront, the impact feels lessened. This isn't owing to a lack of craft or plot setup. The very first single-shot sequence in the film is a stamp of brilliance. DOP Velraj takes us in and out of a trainwreck, making audiences wonder how seamlessly he navigates the milieu. We then move to Kumaresan's side of things, with Soori exhibiting remarkable restraint in a role that requires him to be forbearing, naive, and endearing without an ounce of his usual loudness.Once the basic story idea is detailed (in the first 20 minutes) by Rajiv Menon's character, I quickly concluded that Vetri had to rely entirely on the craftsmanship of his on-and-off-screen crew to pull off something worthwhile. The writing is solid when it focuses on the tender romance between Kumaresan and Tamilarasi (Bhavani Sre) in the first half, building a very raw emotional connect while at it. The circumstances for love blossoming between the two are neatly sketched, and Ilaiyaraaja's score helps bring them to life. Kumaresan's perspective is also that of the audience's, but in between, the film takes us out of it to offer the larger picture, where politics, business, and hierarchy within the systems are exposed.Again, this is one of those films where the "terrorists" are the good guys, whereas the barbaric cops (who rape womenfolk and beat up/shoot the menfolk) who hunt them, are the bad guys. The fluidly shot opening sequence is meant to make us hate the terrorists, but since we've seen this play out so many times, we know it's getting subverted later on. This whole narrative has run out of juice, but the few scenes that randomly feature Vijay Sethupathi's Perumal "Vaathiyaar", the leader of the People's Army, are fiery. The sequel teaser at the end seems like it sheds a lot more light on Perumal's side of the story, making the eventual payoff a lot better. Here, we just get to know him in bits and pieces, and as is the case with most revolutions, it all begins with something deeply personal which then escalates into a community-wide issue.The second half of Part: 1 suffers from being a bit disjointed (the editing is bizarre at times), emotionally lacking, and showcasing an overdose of cop violence. A few Karnans and Jai Bhims later, cop brutality comes across as an excuse to put the protagonist in a wavering situation where he has to make dangerous choices. It does help that the punishments that Kumaresan is subjected to throughout the film by his senior officer, breaks his shell of innocence and provokes him to fight back. Viduthalai simply feels like a story that requires better detailing for the antagonist, and while that's definitely going to be delivered in Part II, it also makes the ending of Part I seem like temporary closure. Also, did Vetri rewrite some dialogues before they were dubbed? I mention this because there are at least a handful of scenes where the lipsync is completely off (especially when Rajiv Menon or Gautham Menon are involved).P. S - I'm just hoping Part II comes soon enough, unlike Vada Chennai 2!P. P. S - I couldn't help but wonder how SaNa would've handled the score in those scenes where GVM and his team of cops attack and torture an entire village!, Ever since the trailer was released, I have been looking forward to see how Soori would've fit in and after watching it, Vetri did deliver what it promised. Not in wildest dream that I could imagine Soori playing a lead and he has proved it. I am not an audience of Vetrimaran's template of gratuitous violence. He reeks of this kasthapadura vada Chennai folks in most of his films.Anyway, coming this film, it was surprising to hear Soori lend his voice for the disclaimer in the beginning. You know his English pronunciation, when Soori uttered 'Alchogal' the whole theatre bursts into giggles. But the mouth shut moment follows right after the disclaimer note. I must say it was so quite when the train accident was playing, there were couple of people passing comments as it unfolded and i could sense lump in throats as they couldn't utter any word. Man, I would say this one of the best achievements by Vetri. Don't care about the Japanese blurred scenes but the Train sequence really did it for me, not exaggerating it for shock value. This tension is maintained but not throughout the runtime, I must say it felt like a different Vetri film with all his usual mantra like the police brutality, caste politics, plight of indigenous and harassment of junior police.I must say Soori nailed the role, he was so credible as a cop, a driver and so humane. He shocked me, he looked so believable in a serious role here as it demanded much more than usual characterization in general films. He doesn't hesitate to do good to serve people. Sometimes his innocence really did help in vouching for this character. He has done some tough action scenes and his confrontation in the climax with VJS is one of the best. Soori gave everything for this film, so happy for him.Now I know why Arunpetra Jothi song was placed in the opening, it was my first time hearing it .Staged so beautifully from up above as if there is a divine intervention followed by Kumaresan (Soori) intro. You may wonder why stage a song like this when the film showcases corpses, blurred every time. But Soori is somehow saved from death like situations in the film. His relationship with his lover and the letters for his mother were some of the best moments too. I am looking forward to see what he does in PS Vinothraj's upcoming Kottukkaali, you must see his Pebbles, do peep my review for the filmThe moment we get a glimpse of The Mentor aka Vathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi) it is so chilling. How Soori was so close while he was dropping Vathiyar and his team. The final confrontation is so heavy, really felt the tension throughout. When Soori who is not in his uniform takes charge and leads the hunt, every scene is staged carefully with superb angles. The moment he picks up the gun, gosh what a brilliant scene. These days we only get actors play grey or anti-hero and it was so refreshing to see a good Samaritan kind of protagonist after some timeI know so many artists have done their part including GVM as Sunil Menon a man who dislikes perverse act as a method in the investigation. But the tables turn, and we get to see two sides of him in the runtime. We have Rajiv Menon and Sarvana Subbaiah, two directors who have done directed classics like Kandukondein Kandukondein and Ajith Kumar's Citizen by the latter. Nice to see both in the film. Even Chetan was damn good as a filthy cop who literally develops dissent on Soori for hurting his ego. It's been a while that I saw him in an intense role, I remember watching him in Vijay Jaypals Revelation (2016) long back. VJS did his part as Vathiyar, he gets a mass moment when he is full naked in the part 2 sneak peek. Post climax snippets for the sequel really did leave me wanting to see more.Final note, This might sound very clichéd, but Vidhhuthalai is not a cinema for everyone. Be cautious as it will put you off. It is heavy film at times which is supported by an amazing score by legendary illayaraja that manages to offer palpable tension in parts. This is my favorite Vetri fillm and I'm hyped already for the sequel., The story of the movie is similar to many of other movies.. every criminal will have a story to justify his crimes but to glorify him is nothing but subtle propaganda. This movie is unlike vetrimarans earlier movies. Which were grippy. Mr Soori has done a great job and it's good to see him as a lead.Few scenes are unwatchable and it's made in such a way to leave a lasting impact on the people.Ilayaraja's background score is good but songs aren't nice.Mr Chetan has played AS a ruthless cop, but somehow tamilpadam 2 scenes flash in your mind
Gvm plays a very small role but to perfection.Overall it's disappointing to say the least.My theatre was empty and I could see the disappointment in everyone's face., Vetrimaran is back to a gritty narration with rooted characters and intense drama. The story is a police operation to capture a terrorist. Vijay Sethupathi is impactful, though his screen time is very very little. Soori is too good for this role and the man is always at the whims of his hierarchy of superiors.The good thing is it don't get preachy and just shows characters as characters. The hierarchy of police and a man standing against practicality is well established. Soori is good following his conscience which yields the wrath of his superiors.Its a clash between ideologies and eagerly waiting for part 2., Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) :
Brief Review -An interesting film with strong performances and a flawed screenplay. The atrocities of the police department have been exposed by several movies from the south markets (including three big industries), and many have been damn brutal and vivid about the context. Here, Viduthalai has the perfect pretext to make another attempt against the atrocities and inhuman behaviour of cops, but the screenplay is lost somewhere. The love story, overblown police officers, a too honest but too weak protagonist, and a super strong villain with a super small screen space doom this interesting crime drama. The film is about the police department's attempt to arrest the members of the People's Army and their leader, Perumal. A constable joins the police force, but his honesty puts him down. He is punished and humiliated by one of his seniors, and over time he learns about the inhumane practises of the police, which end up affecting his love interest. His social conscience isn't permanent. He seems confused about which to choose among his duty, the torture, his lady love, and Perumal. Why can't he make one good decision, I mean, just one goddamn decision. He was supposed to answer his senior's memo in 24 hours; what happened to that? He can pick up any gun and start shooting criminals when he is not allowed to do so. He can become a superhero in the climax, while the whole freaking time, he was a naive, honest, but cowardly constable. Soori gave a solid performance, but I wonder why the writing wasn't solid. Vijay Sethupathi is wasted, and I hope they use him well in Part 2. The plot is open, predictable, and quite repetitive. Vetrimaaran's direction is slightly better than his writing, but you can't make a great film without great writing and a great screenplay in such cases. Viduthalai falls short of its potential but is still a fine one-time watch. It could've been crispier, though.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest., Viduthalai part 1 staring Soori, vijay sethupathi, Bhavani sree, Chetan, GVM in lead roles have absolutely done their best on this wonderful script which is well executed on the screen with out any lags is a first highlight of movie, the story revolves between the a part of tribal people who are fighting against the police, Cinematography, Rerecording are at the best which is well executed at necessary scenes on screen, the wait to see vjs on screen is well enriched with supportive scenes, the potential of actor soori is well displayed on screen,the next part of Viduthalai will hopefully conclude with solutions for part1.Credits to Vetrimaran &amp; Team.]
