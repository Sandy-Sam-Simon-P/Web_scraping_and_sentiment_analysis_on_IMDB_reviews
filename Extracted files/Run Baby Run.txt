['', Saw the film to kill some time and came back disappointed. This movie has a lot of loopholes and the narration has many weak areas. From the very start, there are many unexplainable circumstances which don't make sense. Here are some:
1. The hero goes jewellery shopping and forgets to centrally lock his car (highly unlikely behavior for a person with a high end car) which allows a character to get into this car and hide. And who chooses someone's car as a hiding place?2. A person's first reaction on seeing a stranger in the car is to stop and confront the intruder but Balaji somehow masks the fact from his fianc√© (if you are about to get married screaming and exposing the intruder is what any sane guy would do)3. The fact that the hero allows the stranger to use his guest room in his house unsupervised defies commonsense.4. The fact that Balaji goes to sleep when there is a stranger in his house is unfathomable.5. The hero's marriage is called off when pictures of him sleeping with missing character (fabricated) is shared with his relatives. Any person with half a brain would wonder ....who takes photos of himself with a woman using another person?6. Aishwarya Rajesh not checking the view binder in a stranger's house and anyway allowing the person she suspects the most ( while waiting for her guardian) is also something hard to understand.I think the director thought confusing the people thoroughly and just making people guess is what goes into making a thriller. The only saving grace of the film was Balaji's measured acting. You can definitely give this movie a miss., RATED 6/10

Source: HotstarThe movie starts as a good thriller and maintained the pace very well with continuous events. After one point it is so predictable and lost its pace. The initial suicide scene itself explained the story and reason behind the murder.Some scenes are so spoon feeding and irritates more. Too much of RJ Balaji presence (especially in the cemetery scene) spoils the fun.Nothing new in the motive and villain. When the motive becomes so simple, the whole thrill scenes becomes like puppet show.This could have been better in lot other ways. Excepts some good scenes, this one is easily avoidable., Excellent Tamil thriller after a long time. Indian producers now understand about us the silent majority who like to see movies with some substance, not always the masala movie that our kollywood is spurning out in mass.The movie was well made although the first half took too long to get to the point. Story was good, the suspense was Hitchcock like. So yes let's give us more movies like this.Very grateful to the writer and the producers. A hint to the producers: Watch Hitchcock's Conflict with Humphrey Bogart and you might get an idea for your next movie. We will be supporting you. Good luck!, There's a trend in Tamil Cinema where there are sequences of films in the crime genre with almost a similar kinda plot all over where the main characters try to hide the dead body for which they weren't the cause of it and their struggle to hide that dead body is the core of the plot. This kinda plot most probably started off by the Super Deluxe director and it is still continuing even after several years of its release.And this film in particular took that core part and made the sequences in 0.001x speed which literally dragged down the whole film, in fact, 70% of the movie is just about that and if you remove that sequence then this becomes more like a short film that's not even worth to put it on youtube for free for people to watch. Just give a thought to that thought process and you'll get a gist of how utterly wasteful the movie would have been.The big question is how come, an actor/director like RJ-Balaji chose this kinda subject., A good thriller has a strong base plot and then the screenplay takes a neat run around and gets a major turn towards the climax, but what happened here is the first half was neatly executed and post interval the way the plot unfolds seems to be deliberately altered shows immature skill of the director but his intention are good enough for an average thriller...
R.j Balaji carries the movie single-handedly with his subtle performance and scores better
The rest of the character seems to be just show off, especially the police character seems to be creating hype but ends flat...
Overall an average thriller to pass out in time., Where is this movie leading to?There are so many plot holes, poor screenplay, least engaging movie ever.At one point (cemetery scene) I don't understand where is this movie leading to.Some random girl dying in rjb house but he's not calling cops, some random girl body found in share care and the car wala takes all the effort in the world to cremate the body but he doesn't call cops. But the smart crematorium wala called the cops. After all this rjb comes home and sleep peacefully. Suddenly radhika appears out of nowhere. The car wala guy commits suicide for the crime.that he didn't commit. He could've called cops first itself. Unending random nonsense. Movie got over in intermission but I have no clue why did it keep going for 1.5hrs more. Why? Why?? Why???, Run Baby Run was not bad as it was loaded with suspense, there was no way to tell the end from the beginning as we were suspecting everyone. Overall, the story was gripping, it's just that the unfolding of the mystery plus the acting were okDELICIOUS-One good thing that Run Baby Run did not do was waste time. A few minutes into the opening scenes, we were already taken to the moment Thara (Aishwarya Rai) entered Sathya's life. From there, it was a series of intriguing sequences that fueled the mystery around Aishwarya-We appreciated Sathya's pure spirit and selflessness, despite all his misfortunes, he still empathized with the innocent and insisted on making the wrongs right. Something we seldom see nowadaysBLAND-With a title like 'Run Baby Run', we were waiting to see a chase, people running for their lives, or some form of running, yet there was none ü§î-The CGI visuals were highly noticeable (e.g. Sathya's apartment complex) which hurt the realism of the story. Additionally, the cinematography was plain, it didn't elevate the film's quality-General acting was passable: RJ was the same from beginning to end, we didn't see much enthusiasm for his role-The uncovering of the truth was executed in a typical way that wasn't thought-provoking and the lack of a parallel narrative rendered the film monotonous., What a start and sensational first half ! That phone call at the interval was perfectly timed to make this a memorable second half. But the film just started loosing out as the second half progressed as instead of the policeman given an important role and fight sequences, the joker of a main character, whose the film's biggest weakness , is shown as a hero - just bad storyline in the last half hour to a hour. Even the end doesn't justify the starting sequences at all.How can they mess up such a great script at the end or towards the end ? What a lame can't act at all main character chosen ? Really messed up a 10/10 first half to a 2/10 second half., Movie started well but it does not carry the momentum, The pace of the movie went down after first 20 mins, After a point you can narrate the story along with director since it is very easily guessable plot. There is lots of well known faces in this movie but they never been utilized properly. RJ Balaji has improved a lot with his acting, few fight scenes were but they did well. Even they tried include the diverting scenes to keep audience guessing but unfortunately it ended up noting. Sam CS music is fine, editing and Cinematography is fine too, Screenplay could have been better and one more good thing about the movie is, It is not a long movie though it is slow., Not worthy. I mean they tried their best, yet the movie is same old sloppy mediocre whodunnit story, that didn't do any justice to any actors or the title. I mean why Isha Talwar, Aiswarya Rajesh, Smrithi Venkat? Any random actors would have played the same.The movie is focused on one protagonist only. All other characters doesn't have anything to do with the story. RJ Balaji mistook this one.Though the antagonist identity was revealed only at climax, the movie has lot of "WH" questions than answers. The movie didn't pick any pace moves in same speed throughout the end. Thank God no songs., 1st half of the movie nice.But plot of the movie and climax not good. Can't imagine that villain character actually holds a respectable position of a college. The director could have structured the second half of the movie more thrilling.Disappointment at the end. Moreover, the heroine of the movie looks suspicious from the beginning like she herself had committed a crime.

This movie has a lot of loopholes and the narration has many weak areas. From the very start, there are many unexplainable circumstances which don't make sense. Here are some:
1. The hero goes jewellery shopping and forgets to centrally lock his car (highly unlikely behavior for a person with a high end car) which allows a character to get into this car and hide. And who chooses someone's car as a hiding place?2. A person's first reaction on seeing a stranger in the car is to stop and confront the intruder but Balaji somehow masks the fact from his fianc√© (if you are about to get married screaming and exposing the intruder is what any sane guy would do)3. The fact that the hero allows the stranger to use his guest room in his house unsupervised defies commonsense.4. The fact that Balaji goes to sleep when there is a stranger in his house is unfathomable.5. The hero's marriage is called off when pictures of him sleeping with missing character (fabricated) is shared with his relatives. Any person with half a brain would wonder ....who takes photos of himself with a woman using another person?6. Aishwarya Rajesh not checking the view binder in a stranger's house and anyway allowing the person she suspects the most ( while waiting for her guardian) is also something hard to understand.I think the director thought confusing the people thoroughly and just making people guess is what goes into making a thriller. The only saving grace of the film was Balaji's measured acting. You can definitely give this movie a miss., RATED 6/10

Source: HotstarThe movie starts as a good thriller and maintained the pace very well with continuous events. After one point it is so predictable and lost its pace. The initial suicide scene itself explained the story and reason behind the murder.Some scenes are so spoon feeding and irritates more. Too much of RJ Balaji presence (especially in the cemetery scene) spoils the fun.Nothing new in the motive and villain. When the motive becomes so simple, the whole thrill scenes becomes like puppet show.This could have been better in lot other ways. Excepts some good scenes, this one is easily avoidable., Excellent Tamil thriller after a long time. Indian producers now understand about us the silent majority who like to see movies with some substance, not always the masala movie that our kollywood is spurning out in mass.The movie was well made although the first half took too long to get to the point. Story was good, the suspense was Hitchcock like. So yes let's give us more movies like this.Very grateful to the writer and the producers. A hint to the producers: Watch Hitchcock's Conflict with Humphrey Bogart and you might get an idea for your next movie. We will be supporting you. Good luck!, There's a trend in Tamil Cinema where there are sequences of films in the crime genre with almost a similar kinda plot all over where the main characters try to hide the dead body for which they weren't the cause of it and their struggle to hide that dead body is the core of the plot. This kinda plot most probably started off by the Super Deluxe director and it is still continuing even after several years of its release.And this film in particular took that core part and made the sequences in 0.001x speed which literally dragged down the whole film, in fact, 70% of the movie is just about that and if you remove that sequence then this becomes more like a short film that's not even worth to put it on youtube for free for people to watch. Just give a thought to that thought process and you'll get a gist of how utterly wasteful the movie would have been.The big question is how come, an actor/director like RJ-Balaji chose this kinda subject., A good thriller has a strong base plot and then the screenplay takes a neat run around and gets a major turn towards the climax, but what happened here is the first half was neatly executed and post interval the way the plot unfolds seems to be deliberately altered shows immature skill of the director but his intention are good enough for an average thriller...
R.j Balaji carries the movie single-handedly with his subtle performance and scores better
The rest of the character seems to be just show off, especially the police character seems to be creating hype but ends flat...
Overall an average thriller to pass out in time., Where is this movie leading to?There are so many plot holes, poor screenplay, least engaging movie ever.At one point (cemetery scene) I don't understand where is this movie leading to.Some random girl dying in rjb house but he's not calling cops, some random girl body found in share care and the car wala takes all the effort in the world to cremate the body but he doesn't call cops. But the smart crematorium wala called the cops. After all this rjb comes home and sleep peacefully. Suddenly radhika appears out of nowhere. The car wala guy commits suicide for the crime.that he didn't commit. He could've called cops first itself. Unending random nonsense. Movie got over in intermission but I have no clue why did it keep going for 1.5hrs more. Why? Why?? Why???, Run Baby Run was not bad as it was loaded with suspense, there was no way to tell the end from the beginning as we were suspecting everyone. Overall, the story was gripping, it's just that the unfolding of the mystery plus the acting were okDELICIOUS-One good thing that Run Baby Run did not do was waste time. A few minutes into the opening scenes, we were already taken to the moment Thara (Aishwarya Rai) entered Sathya's life. From there, it was a series of intriguing sequences that fueled the mystery around Aishwarya-We appreciated Sathya's pure spirit and selflessness, despite all his misfortunes, he still empathized with the innocent and insisted on making the wrongs right. Something we seldom see nowadaysBLAND-With a title like 'Run Baby Run', we were waiting to see a chase, people running for their lives, or some form of running, yet there was none ü§î-The CGI visuals were highly noticeable (e.g. Sathya's apartment complex) which hurt the realism of the story. Additionally, the cinematography was plain, it didn't elevate the film's quality-General acting was passable: RJ was the same from beginning to end, we didn't see much enthusiasm for his role-The uncovering of the truth was executed in a typical way that wasn't thought-provoking and the lack of a parallel narrative rendered the film monotonous., What a start and sensational first half ! That phone call at the interval was perfectly timed to make this a memorable second half. But the film just started loosing out as the second half progressed as instead of the policeman given an important role and fight sequences, the joker of a main character, whose the film's biggest weakness , is shown as a hero - just bad storyline in the last half hour to a hour. Even the end doesn't justify the starting sequences at all.How can they mess up such a great script at the end or towards the end ? What a lame can't act at all main character chosen ? Really messed up a 10/10 first half to a 2/10 second half., Movie started well but it does not carry the momentum, The pace of the movie went down after first 20 mins, After a point you can narrate the story along with director since it is very easily guessable plot. There is lots of well known faces in this movie but they never been utilized properly. RJ Balaji has improved a lot with his acting, few fight scenes were but they did well. Even they tried include the diverting scenes to keep audience guessing but unfortunately it ended up noting. Sam CS music is fine, editing and Cinematography is fine too, Screenplay could have been better and one more good thing about the movie is, It is not a long movie though it is slow., Not worthy. I mean they tried their best, yet the movie is same old sloppy mediocre whodunnit story, that didn't do any justice to any actors or the title. I mean why Isha Talwar, Aiswarya Rajesh, Smrithi Venkat? Any random actors would have played the same.The movie is focused on one protagonist only. All other characters doesn't have anything to do with the story. RJ Balaji mistook this one.Though the antagonist identity was revealed only at climax, the movie has lot of "WH" questions than answers.

This movie has a lot of loopholes and the narration has many weak areas. From the very start, there are many unexplainable circumstances which don't make sense. Here are some:
1. The hero goes jewellery shopping and forgets to centrally lock his car (highly unlikely behavior for a person with a high end car) which allows a character to get into this car and hide. And who chooses someone's car as a hiding place?2. A person's first reaction on seeing a stranger in the car is to stop and confront the intruder but Balaji somehow masks the fact from his fianc√© (if you are about to get married screaming and exposing the intruder is what any sane guy would do)3. The fact that the hero allows the stranger to use his guest room in his house unsupervised defies commonsense.4. The fact that Balaji goes to sleep when there is a stranger in his house is unfathomable.5. The hero's marriage is called off when pictures of him sleeping with missing character (fabricated) is shared with his relatives. Any person with half a brain would wonder ....who takes photos of himself with a woman using another person?6. Aishwarya Rajesh not checking the view binder in a stranger's house and anyway allowing the person she suspects the most ( while waiting for her guardian) is also something hard to understand.I think the director thought confusing the people thoroughly and just making people guess is what goes into making a thriller. The only saving grace of the film was Balaji's measured acting. You can definitely give this movie a miss., RATED 6/10

Source: HotstarThe movie starts as a good thriller and maintained the pace very well with continuous events. After one point it is so predictable and lost its pace. The initial suicide scene itself explained the story and reason behind the murder.Some scenes are so spoon feeding and irritates more. Too much of RJ Balaji presence (especially in the cemetery scene) spoils the fun.Nothing new in the motive and villain. When the motive becomes so simple, the whole thrill scenes becomes like puppet show.This could have been better in lot other ways. Excepts some good scenes, this one is easily avoidable., Excellent Tamil thriller after a long time. Indian producers now understand about us the silent majority who like to see movies with some substance, not always the masala movie that our kollywood is spurning out in mass.The movie was well made although the first half took too long to get to the point. Story was good, the suspense was Hitchcock like. So yes let's give us more movies like this.Very grateful to the writer and the producers. A hint to the producers: Watch Hitchcock's Conflict with Humphrey Bogart and you might get an idea for your next movie. We will be supporting you. Good luck!, There's a trend in Tamil Cinema where there are sequences of films in the crime genre with almost a similar kinda plot all over where the main characters try to hide the dead body for which they weren't the cause of it and their struggle to hide that dead body is the core of the plot. This kinda plot most probably started off by the Super Deluxe director and it is still continuing even after several years of its release.And this film in particular took that core part and made the sequences in 0.001x speed which literally dragged down the whole film, in fact, 70% of the movie is just about that and if you remove that sequence then this becomes more like a short film that's not even worth to put it on youtube for free for people to watch. Just give a thought to that thought process and you'll get a gist of how utterly wasteful the movie would have been.The big question is how come, an actor/director like RJ-Balaji chose this kinda subject., A good thriller has a strong base plot and then the screenplay takes a neat run around and gets a major turn towards the climax, but what happened here is the first half was neatly executed and post interval the way the plot unfolds seems to be deliberately altered shows immature skill of the director but his intention are good enough for an average thriller...
R.j Balaji carries the movie single-handedly with his subtle performance and scores better
The rest of the character seems to be just show off, especially the police character seems to be creating hype but ends flat...
Overall an average thriller to pass out in time., Where is this movie leading to?There are so many plot holes, poor screenplay, least engaging movie ever.At one point (cemetery scene) I don't understand where is this movie leading to.Some random girl dying in rjb house but he's not calling cops, some random girl body found in share care and the car wala takes all the effort in the world to cremate the body but he doesn't call cops. But the smart crematorium wala called the cops. After all this rjb comes home and sleep peacefully. Suddenly radhika appears out of nowhere. The car wala guy commits suicide for the crime.that he didn't commit. He could've called cops first itself. Unending random nonsense. Movie got over in intermission but I have no clue why did it keep going for 1.5hrs more. Why? Why?? Why???, Run Baby Run was not bad as it was loaded with suspense, there was no way to tell the end from the beginning as we were suspecting everyone. Overall, the story was gripping, it's just that the unfolding of the mystery plus the acting were okDELICIOUS-One good thing that Run Baby Run did not do was waste time. A few minutes into the opening scenes, we were already taken to the moment Thara (Aishwarya Rai) entered Sathya's life. From there, it was a series of intriguing sequences that fueled the mystery around Aishwarya-We appreciated Sathya's pure spirit and selflessness, despite all his misfortunes, he still empathized with the innocent and insisted on making the wrongs right. Something we seldom see nowadaysBLAND-With a title like 'Run Baby Run', we were waiting to see a chase, people running for their lives, or some form of running, yet there was none ü§î-The CGI visuals were highly noticeable (e.g. Sathya's apartment complex) which hurt the realism of the story. Additionally, the cinematography was plain, it didn't elevate the film's quality-General acting was passable: RJ was the same from beginning to end, we didn't see much enthusiasm for his role-The uncovering of the truth was executed in a typical way that wasn't thought-provoking and the lack of a parallel narrative rendered the film monotonous., What a start and sensational first half ! That phone call at the interval was perfectly timed to make this a memorable second half. But the film just started loosing out as the second half progressed as instead of the policeman given an important role and fight sequences, the joker of a main character, whose the film's biggest weakness , is shown as a hero - just bad storyline in the last half hour to a hour. Even the end doesn't justify the starting sequences at all.How can they mess up such a great script at the end or towards the end ? What a lame can't act at all main character chosen ? Really messed up a 10/10 first half to a 2/10 second half., Movie started well but it does not carry the momentum, The pace of the movie went down after first 20 mins, After a point you can narrate the story along with director since it is very easily guessable plot. There is lots of well known faces in this movie but they never been utilized properly. RJ Balaji has improved a lot with his acting, few fight scenes were but they did well.

There is lots of well known faces in this movie but they never been utilized properly. RJ Balaji has improved a lot with his acting, few fight scenes were but they did well. Even they tried include the diverting scenes to keep audience guessing but unfortunately it ended up noting. Sam CS music is fine, editing and Cinematography is fine too, Screenplay could have been better and one more good thing about the movie is, It is not a long movie though it is slow., Not worthy. I mean they tried their best, yet the movie is same old sloppy mediocre whodunnit story, that didn't do any justice to any actors or the title. I mean why Isha Talwar, Aiswarya Rajesh, Smrithi Venkat? Any random actors would have played the same.The movie is focused on one protagonist only. All other characters doesn't have anything to do with the story. RJ Balaji mistook this one.Though the antagonist identity was revealed only at climax, the movie has lot of "WH" questions than answers. The movie didn't pick any pace moves in same speed throughout the end. Thank God no songs., 1st half of the movie nice.But plot of the movie and climax not good. Can't imagine that villain character actually holds a respectable position of a college. The director could have structured the second half of the movie more thrilling.Disappointment at the end. Moreover, the heroine of the movie looks suspicious from the beginning like she herself had committed a crime. If a person is really in a bad situation then should explain the situation to the police officers to put an end. Rather, the heroine character took the responsibility by herself and fights for the injustice happened to her friend is strange.]
