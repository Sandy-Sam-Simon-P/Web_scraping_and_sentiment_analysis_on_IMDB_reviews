One of the blockbuster film of this year. Enjoy in Theatres!, Title: "Laughably Unfunny Disaster: A Comedy Film That Failed to Deliver"
As a connoisseur of comedy, I eagerly anticipated the release of the so-called "DD Returns" film that had been hyped up by critics and marketing. But, alas, what unfolded before my eyes was nothing short of a catastrophe. This film turned out to be an abysmal attempt at humor, leaving me more perplexed than amused.From the very beginning, it was evident that the screenplay lacked any originality or wit. The jokes were recycled, stale, and predictable. I found myself yawning instead of laughing as the movie's so-called "punchlines" fell flat, one after the other. The comedic timing was non-existent, leaving the actors stumbling awkwardly through scenes that were supposed to be hilarious.The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable. Their attempts to elicit laughter were nothing more than cringe-worthy caricatures. I couldn't connect with any of them, which made it difficult to care about their fates or find their misadventures amusing. The slapstick comedy, in particular, felt forced and overused, adding to the overall sense of discomfort rather than genuine laughter., This movie is hilarious. Unlike Santhanam's other movies this movie is actually funny. So many memorable characters and the way they all connect together is just really well made. The only thing that was not good was the cgi but let's be real, no one cares about cgi in these types of movie. Also unlike other comedy films or comedy/horror films of Kollywood, this movie has a story and the ending actually takes you to the edge of the seat. Apart from this, there is no adult jokes making it a very good film to watch with your family. Also yes DD Returns is Dhilluku Dhuddu 3 and this sequel is times better than either of the first 2 films., A massive waste of time and effort without even working on dialogues.I was waiting throughout the whole movie to laugh at some point in the film. Redin Kingsley is the reason I can condone that this movie.Pathukku pathu kuduthavanugaulkellam manasatchiye illiya da!? Valkaila ningellam nalla padame paathadhu illaya? Idhu 10/10 na pariyerum perumal evlo? Ratchasan evlo? Jai bheem evlo?Chandramukhi first half is what you call horror comedy done right. Comedy is a serious business. Comedians understand this. Anyone who doesn't understand this becomes a buffon.The point of ghosts in Tamil cinema has become a caricature. The director has to be a master of coercion. This movie is a gross misunderstanding of that because he has coerced the producer to make this godawful abomination that should never have been lifted off the editors table., What a fun filled ride , entirely enjoyable movie worth the money spent , Santhanam has a unique way of choosing scripts and cast. He knows what makes audience get engaged with timing comedies, After dhilluku dhuddu , DD Returns is the more enjoyable movie from santhanam.Special mention to art department, Extrodinary set work was so real it was and the bgm was just awesome &amp; the camera work superb.CG work was also good for the movie..i wonder how kollywood creates such a promising CG work and movies with the minimum budget.Its still ok if the movie had logic loop holes but the way screenplay was written and the timing comedies makes it more engaging..whole theater were laughing till the end of the movie ðŸ˜‚.Try to Dub this movie in multi language and make it pan indian material or even pan world material.Majaa ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¥, I didn't know what to expect when I saw this on its day of release (in UK with English subtitles) with limited info out there, but I was in the mood for something a little light hearted and I like horror so this looked the part judging from the trailers.I wasn't disappointed with lots of chuckles, some very ropey effects in places which didn't matter, chases, a myriad of characters we got to know in the first half and then into the haunted house for the second half of the film.Strangely the trailers seem to ignore the first half of the film outside the haunted house which left me a bit confused but eventually we got to the creepy house.In summary in the first half of the film there's a wedding that gets interrupted and we get to know several groups of people, some of whom plan to steal a load of money. This sets up themes around love, revenge, kidnap and greed and there's a lot of hilarity. It reminded me of old slapstick comedies with the loot passing from one group to another with various chases.Eventually the various groups converge on the old haunted house and find themselves being forced to play 'Win or Run' to escape with their lives (and win the money) which is what the trailers focussed on, with more peril and hilarity.Good escapist fun., We really enjoyed the movie from the beginning, especially second half was amazing.... My stomach started aching because of the fun filled scenes... We can enjoy the movie with the flow irrespective of the logic.... In some scenes, logic didnt work but it was good... For many scenes, entire theater burst into laughter.... Appreciating the director for not keeping multiple songs or fights, which is a plus for the movie too... Good movie for a weekend... Am sure kids will enjoy... Heroine was so cute and bubbly to see on the screen, it was good to see Sandy's dance steps and sandy too... Overall movie is a nice treat for all of us ðŸ˜‡, Awesome movie songs in the movie are boring but very good overall performance.Though the graphics are bad it is a family movie.

This sets up themes around love, revenge, kidnap and greed and there's a lot of hilarity. It reminded me of old slapstick comedies with the loot passing from one group to another with various chases.Eventually the various groups converge on the old haunted house and find themselves being forced to play 'Win or Run' to escape with their lives (and win the money) which is what the trailers focussed on, with more peril and hilarity.Good escapist fun., We really enjoyed the movie from the beginning, especially second half was amazing.... My stomach started aching because of the fun filled scenes... We can enjoy the movie with the flow irrespective of the logic.... In some scenes, logic didnt work but it was good... For many scenes, entire theater burst into laughter.... Appreciating the director for not keeping multiple songs or fights, which is a plus for the movie too... Good movie for a weekend... Am sure kids will enjoy... Heroine was so cute and bubbly to see on the screen, it was good to see Sandy's dance steps and sandy too... Overall movie is a nice treat for all of us ðŸ˜‡, Awesome movie songs in the movie are boring but very good overall performance.Though the graphics are bad it is a family movie.

As a connoisseur of comedy, I eagerly anticipated the release of the so-called "DD Returns" film that had been hyped up by critics and marketing. But, alas, what unfolded before my eyes was nothing short of a catastrophe. This film turned out to be an abysmal attempt at humor, leaving me more perplexed than amused.From the very beginning, it was evident that the screenplay lacked any originality or wit. The jokes were recycled, stale, and predictable. I found myself yawning instead of laughing as the movie's so-called "punchlines" fell flat, one after the other. The comedic timing was non-existent, leaving the actors stumbling awkwardly through scenes that were supposed to be hilarious.The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable. Their attempts to elicit laughter were nothing more than cringe-worthy caricatures. I couldn't connect with any of them, which made it difficult to care about their fates or find their misadventures amusing. The slapstick comedy, in particular, felt forced and overused, adding to the overall sense of discomfort rather than genuine laughter., This movie is hilarious. Unlike Santhanam's other movies this movie is actually funny. So many memorable characters and the way they all connect together is just really well made. The only thing that was not good was the cgi but let's be real, no one cares about cgi in these types of movie. Also unlike other comedy films or comedy/horror films of Kollywood, this movie has a story and the ending actually takes you to the edge of the seat. Apart from this, there is no adult jokes making it a very good film to watch with your family. Also yes DD Returns is Dhilluku Dhuddu 3 and this sequel is times better than either of the first 2 films., A massive waste of time and effort without even working on dialogues.I was waiting throughout the whole movie to laugh at some point in the film. Redin Kingsley is the reason I can condone that this movie.Pathukku pathu kuduthavanugaulkellam manasatchiye illiya da!? Valkaila ningellam nalla padame paathadhu illaya? Idhu 10/10 na pariyerum perumal evlo? Ratchasan evlo? Jai bheem evlo?Chandramukhi first half is what you call horror comedy done right. Comedy is a serious business. Comedians understand this.

So we're pulling from 100 years of movie history, from those early days of German expressionism (Nosferatu, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) and Universal monsters (Dracula, The Wolf Man). Creature features (King Kong, The Fly) nestle with Best Picture nominees (The Exorcist, Get Out). Slashers (Scream), zombies (Dawn of the Dead), vampires (Let the Right One In) abound with terror of the more psychological persuasion (Don't Look Now, The Innocents). Or so it would seem.And we honor the recent stabs and strides made by female horror directors (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, The Babadook, The Invitation) and directors abroad (Under the Shadow, The Wailing). Each of these best scary movies thrown into our bubbling cauldron had to have at least 20 reviews with a Fresh rating, before being sorted by our ranking formula, which accounts for a movie's number of reviews and year of release.New additions for this year's update include His House and Candyman, and classics like Dario Argento's Creepers creepin' in.Ready to settle in for dark nights of Fresh fear? Then flip the switch on The 200 Best Horror Movies of All Time...it's alive! It's alive!!]
