['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...

"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact. The movie explores themes of bravery, justice, and the power of unity...
"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them.

It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:

So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax.

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...
And that is plagued by social injustice and political unrest. The protagonist, played by sivakarthikeyan, rises up against the oppressors and becomes a beacon of hope for the villagers. As he fights for their rights, he faces numerous challenges and confrontations, testing his determination and enduranc
The cast of "MAAVEERAN" is a talented ensemble of actors who bring their characters to life with conviction and depth. Special credits to Saritha of what she can do or capable off...
The director's vision shines through in "MAAVEERAN," as they skillfully navigate the complex storyline and bring out the best in the actors. The screenplay strikes a balance between intense action sequences and poignant emotional moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.Overall
"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact. The movie explores themes of bravery, justice, and the power of unity...
"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing.

How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing.

Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie

The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic.

Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept.

Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax.

The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget.

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...
And that is plagued by social injustice and political unrest. The protagonist, played by sivakarthikeyan, rises up against the oppressors and becomes a beacon of hope for the villagers.

The director's vision shines through in "MAAVEERAN," as they skillfully navigate the complex storyline and bring out the best in the actors. The screenplay strikes a balance between intense action sequences and poignant emotional moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.Overall
"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan.

With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them.

It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one.

The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax.

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...
And that is plagued by social injustice and political unrest. The protagonist, played by sivakarthikeyan, rises up against the oppressors and becomes a beacon of hope for the villagers. As he fights for their rights, he faces numerous challenges and confrontations, testing his determination and enduranc
The cast of "MAAVEERAN" is a talented ensemble of actors who bring their characters to life with conviction and depth. Special credits to Saritha of what she can do or capable off...
The director's vision shines through in "MAAVEERAN," as they skillfully navigate the complex storyline and bring out the best in the actors. The screenplay strikes a balance between intense action sequences and poignant emotional moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.Overall
"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact. The movie explores themes of bravery, justice, and the power of unity...
"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing.

How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing.

Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie

The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic.

Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept.

Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax.

The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget.

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...
And that is plagued by social injustice and political unrest. The protagonist, played by sivakarthikeyan, rises up against the oppressors and becomes a beacon of hope for the villagers.

The director's vision shines through in "MAAVEERAN," as they skillfully navigate the complex storyline and bring out the best in the actors. The screenplay strikes a balance between intense action sequences and poignant emotional moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.Overall
"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan.

With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them.

It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one.

The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax.

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...
And that is plagued by social injustice and political unrest. The protagonist, played by sivakarthikeyan, rises up against the oppressors and becomes a beacon of hope for the villagers. As he fights for their rights, he faces numerous challenges and confrontations, testing his determination and enduranc
The cast of "MAAVEERAN" is a talented ensemble of actors who bring their characters to life with conviction and depth. Special credits to Saritha of what she can do or capable off...
The director's vision shines through in "MAAVEERAN," as they skillfully navigate the complex storyline and bring out the best in the actors. The screenplay strikes a balance between intense action sequences and poignant emotional moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.Overall
"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact. The movie explores themes of bravery, justice, and the power of unity...
"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing.

How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing.

Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie

The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic.

Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept.

Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax.

The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget.

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...
And that is plagued by social injustice and political unrest. The protagonist, played by sivakarthikeyan, rises up against the oppressors and becomes a beacon of hope for the villagers.

The director's vision shines through in "MAAVEERAN," as they skillfully navigate the complex storyline and bring out the best in the actors. The screenplay strikes a balance between intense action sequences and poignant emotional moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.Overall
"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan.

With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them.

It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one.

The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax.

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]['', What is a trait of a hero in Bollywood or a telegu movie? He should be macho,able to beat at least 10 to 12 goons. Here it's totally opposite, he is coward as hell, one scene shows he finally thinks enough and goes with a pencil to beat them. Immediately realizes the wrong in that attempt and returns to the coward self.he keeps on saying life is about adjustments, so adjusting that he keeps on losing his personal space , dignity but hats off to the director the viewers will buy in that concept because he makes the viewer familiar about the heroes trait ( the very first scene shows instead of fighting in the que hero prefers to go to the train to fetch water , which in later part of the story used as a callback)A lovely entertainer with comedic punches where a coward cartoonist is forced to become a warrior as the cartoons world and real world collides. It's a unique concept, presented beautifully where all the characters do their work efficiently ( although except the main hero everyone is a prop without a character arch)., The movie starts with a casual hero who never want to get into any sort of trouble in his life. And he even says - "We have to adjust and live". And, suddenly things change with a auditory hallucination. The good thing is the audience would have "believed" everything post that given it is fantasy. But the writers have carefully made it believable and everything happening in a series of "Final Destination" kind of screenplay with outstanding comedy from Yogi Babu.Sivakarthikeyan is unbelievable in this role juggling between a possessed man who never want to be the chosen one. The small drawback is the climax plot making the villain look silly and foolish!!, MAAVEERAN:
This was a really fun, beautiful film. The making was 💯💯 especially that climax cinematography. The acting was great and to me, Myskkin was a surprise. All the BGMs have that folk dance vibe which made me wanna dance, especially the climax BGM. While the 1st half was filled with comedy, the 2nd half gets less comical and more fun (in terms of dialogues and situations). But, the ending didn't feel that good to me.The female lead only plays the role of most female leads in hero-led movies, which is to give the hero that motivational speech which makes him go rogue.Still, a solid 8.5/10., This is easily SK's best film.1st half was just made very well and it was a laugh riot in theatres even when I watched it after a week of its release.I believe if they would've kept VS's voice unrevealed, it would've been a huge surprise, a missed opportunity.2nd half was sluggish but still not bad at allit's still astonishing to think that a storyline just like the usual Tamil films with a pinch of an added twist of a mind-voice would make a film such an interesting watch with good characterisation &amp; making, this is the best writing ever for a commercial film.Overall, it's a must-watch if you're hungry about not having watched a good movie in a long time., After some long time tamil cinema with some unique concept. The story was well written that from the beginning to end it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. I didn't expect that this movie would this much good.The background voice dialogues are well disciplined tamil world that are pure. Just the way the comic story way. Shiva Karthikeyan did a good movie after some two lazy movies. He showed his true nature acting. Also Yogi Babu s comics timming was good as he is well in that. One of the best things is this movie had very good cinematography. It has range of wide shot from everywhere. Just like you are also part of the movie., In detail, Siva Karthikeyan has nailed his role in this movie with both comedy and action. He merged into his character. When u read comics.. u'll think what if u are a superhero... sure Maaveeran gives u the feel. When great power comes, a great responsibility... this movie does that n engaging... Siva has become a performer in Maaveeran... Yogi did his part very well &amp; will not disappoint audience... Aditi done her role perfectly... Madonne Ashwin tried passing the pain of slum people's sufferings after entering the apartments &amp; did well in that. Myysskkin a good villain with no trace as much. Music &amp; bgm is good. Overall a good entertainer to watch with family n friends... Movie runtime should be trimmed. Rating 3.5/5., Sivakarthikeyan teams up with Madonne Ashwin of Mandela fame for a commercial entertainer. Maaveeran deals with Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan), a common man who is too much of a coward to stand up for anything. He draws comic strips titled Maaveeran, telling the story of a brave warrior who stands up for his people and is fearless to death. A freak accident leaves Sathya with an head injury and he starts hearing voices that make him stand up against the Yemen in the form of a corrupt minister (Mysskin). How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist. Set against the backdrop of a fictional slum ambience,the movie follows the journey of a young man who becomes a symbol of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience...
And that is plagued by social injustice and political unrest. The protagonist, played by sivakarthikeyan, rises up against the oppressors and becomes a beacon of hope for the villagers. As he fights for their rights, he faces numerous challenges and confrontations, testing his determination and enduranc
The cast of "MAAVEERAN" is a talented ensemble of actors who bring their characters to life with conviction and depth. Special credits to Saritha of what she can do or capable off...
The director's vision shines through in "MAAVEERAN," as they skillfully navigate the complex storyline and bring out the best in the actors. The screenplay strikes a balance between intense action sequences and poignant emotional moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie.Overall
"MAAVEERAN" is an engaging Tamil movie that combines action, drama, and social commentary seamlessly. With its strong performances, captivating visuals, and well-crafted storyline, it has the potential to captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact. The movie explores themes of bravery, justice, and the power of unity...
"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing.

How does a coward Sathya transform into a brave warrior forms rest of the story.This indeed is an interesting premise and Madonne Ashwin is in control of the narrative in the first half, aided by the supporting cast led by ever reliable Saritha and Yogi Babu. The humor ensures smooth flow of the first half with back to back entertaining moments. To be specific, it was a good first half. It is the post interval portion where the novelty wears off quickly and it suffers due to lack of entertainment.It went too one dimensional in the second half with the hero vs villain conflict. Though the hero driven by fear, being misused by the baddies sounded so good on paper, what was the executed on screen lacked that impact. The second half became borderline boring due to this and stays predictable throughout. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over is good enough to compliment an earnest Sivakarthikeyan, but the second half deserved better writing., SK rocks his role as a timid cowardly low class cartoonist. Story was simple and straightforward with unique element. Cinematography was mediocre and action cinematography could have been better. The use of close up shots in few comedy scene made said scenes more hilarious. Music by bharath was good but his bgm could have been more gritty. Yogi babu steals the show with his comedy timing. While, Myskin's character could have been more stronger but his performance was good. It's vital that we support these kinda out of the box films. So go and watch it in theaters.Overall it's a fun film and worth the watch., RATED 8/10

Source: NilThe director proved himself again that he can deliver social message in a commercial content. This time the commercial flavour is bit more, but still enjoyable one. The first half is 10/10, it racy, entertaining at the same time the screenplay is stick to the theme.The second half is quite manageable, but felt bit dragged. Even though the characters and approaching the politician is bit fresh, the predictability killed the entertainment. The climax scene is bit overdose of masala and still justifies to his cartoon story.The voice of imaginary character and how he handles the voice is awesome. The first half it was used for mostly for entertainment and the same is used for very good social message.Worth the watch., I have never seen such unique usage of voiceovers/narrations before; In mainstream entertainers, they are primarily used in flashback scenes or to build anticipation around the central character, but the way 'Maaveeran' used this specific trope is quite intriguing, to say the least.Not to mention, the action or the choreography, to be precise, seemed slightly refreshing as well. The way in which the camera moves and captures every kick and punch; it feels swell and looks damn cool. Some credit must also go to Sivakarthikeyan, who played his part with such unabashed conviction. Nobody else would have done a better job; he looked like an ideal fit for this role.My only major complaint is its 156 minutes duration; it sometimes felt unnecessarily long. Other than that, it's a respectable commercial venture, a familiar dish, albeit served with a distinctive recipe and a much different flavour., I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed Madonne Ashwin's maiden venture Mandela both for its simplicity in storytelling and the inventive use of humour to drive the plot forward. In that review, I spoke of how Mandela was the antithesis to Sarkar, (an A R Murugadoss film) in the one-vote-makes-a-difference story. In Maaveeran, he taps Siva Karthikeyan to play a common man protagonist. A cartoonist by profession, Sathya (SK) sketches a long-running comic strip (about a superhero) in a local daily. While this track runs in one direction, the plot about a crumbling resettlement complex runs in another. It's when both tracks meld into one that the fantasy element kicks in. The first half that takes us through these bits is terrific, even with a few forgettable songs.Yogi Babu plays Patchwork, a restorer who also gets the best lines in the film. His scenes with SK are superb and bring the house down. VJS' voiceover is basically what turns Sathya into a "man of the people", and its familiarity makes us connect with his ideologies quickly. The entire pre-interval set-piece, which may have looked out of place in a film like this, starts to make sense because of the voiceover. Even the way Sathya gets this supposed superpower is a beautifully written (and executed) scene. By the time the antagonists, played by Mysskin and Sunil, are introduced, the film loses some of its inventiveness. While their performances are solid, the writing treats them as generic bad guys doing generic-bad-guy things.The film also starts showing signs of a typical A R Murugadoss flick, featuring loud mothers, concerned crowds, and over-the-top antagonists. The sole purpose of the protagonist then becomes dispensing "mass hero" duties. Even the heroine (a reasonably good Aditi Shankar) takes a backseat in the second half. We're treated to more set pieces and forgettable songs. The humour quotient begins to dry up. VJS' voiceover loses its initial shine. The score is thankfully way better and keeps the fight sequences and elevation moments fun. The climactic set-piece also features some tacky CG, further lessening the overall impact. Alas, we see a great film turn into a good film right before our very eyes.P. S - I'm still fairly excited about what Madonne Ashwin attempts next. It's admirable that he got to keep his OG crew for his sophomore venture., This director Madonne Ashwin has done a previous political comedy drama excellently well. So he has continued to go on with the same political subject. Comedy between Yogi babu and SK are very good but the film is an absolute disastrous experience. Madonne Ashwin's comical way of taking the movie has failed this time. There's so much lag in the film and some scenes are totally irritating. Climax is the most horrible part. If they're gonna have this climax, it should make us feel rather it was very stupid of the director to have such a poor climax. Overall film is an one time watch for the comedy., "MAAVEERAN" is a gripping action drama that revolves around the life of a fear and valiant protagonist.

"MAAVEERAN" is a promising Tamil movie that is compelling with its storyline, powerful performances, and impressive technical aspects, it has the potential to resonate with audiences and make a mark in the Tamil film industry. Whether you are a fan of action dramas or appreciate thought-provoking narratives, "MAAVEERAN" is definitely worth watching., The Movie is just fyaar first half comedy scenes are out of the World 💯 fr...Sivakarthikeyan tried different genre of movie and he come from his comfort zone and did this movie really very well .... Comedy 10/10.... Songs not upto the level actions scenes are good... Myskkin sir did a very good job and adithi also quite good...Yogi Babu comedy and counters are very humorous in this film especially....Ashwin director gave totally different from Mandela his last movie ... But this not equal the level of Mandela ... But maveeran is quite good comedy film...So don't waste your time just book the maveeran tickets and I am also going to book coz I'm going to watch tomorrow show only 🙂👍..., No spoilers! The movie is a family entertainer. Very original script and writing by the National award winner Madonne. All the technicians have done a fantastic job - their hard works shows in every frame of this film. Next, all the actors have done a bloody marvelous job in elevating the film. It was so refreshing to watch Sarita after such a long time, great come back for her! Aditi does justice to her role completely and she is pure talent and hope to see more movies from her. SK, the main lead delivers every emotion right on point; I think comedy-satire is very much in comfort zone of SK, but in this movie you will see him emerge beyond it and clearly delivers a message that he is here to stay. N last but not the least, Yogi Babu - what an actor! Gift to tamil cinema, his combo with SK was so organic and even in a scene where he had no dialogue, you find yourself laughing as if he cracked a big joke. Literally I think he can make you laugh in a mute film.Don't miss watching this clever, entertaining, laugh riot and a movie with many social messages!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end., SK should realise that he's a big actor right now in Kollywood, Doctor made him look like a big star and a mass commercial hero idk why he still chooses to make a low hyped movies like Don, Prince and now Maaveeran but huge respect for SK for choosing a very different story rather than a basic commercial film. Unfortunately Maaveeran is a mid average film, it has a good first half with a lot of content and it was quite engaging but second half was terrible. BGM was not good enough and the songs just felt empty.SK should throw away his typical comedy films and start choosing movies with bigger scale. HIS MOVIE SELECTION IS MOVING HIM AWAY FROM BEING THE NEXT SUPERSTAR!But movie was so much better than Don and Prince
I'd give a 6/10, expecting a lot for his upcoming film w Kamal Hassan's production. No hope for Ayaalan too since it's gonna be another small scaled typical SK movie like Maan Karate.At this point he should know his market value and start making bigger films., True Comeback for SivakarththikeyanA simple yet effective and intriguing plot with well written characterisation of Sivakarththikeyan. His screen presence was truly engaging and his different style acting suits him very well. The humor sense of the movie is a major neutral point for the movie. The writer blends this socially messaged story with a simple fantasy which makes this unique. 1st half of the movie is already been a treat for the audience, it fairly engages us in the second half. It loses the excitement and interest over the film through certain stages of story development. Still remarkably manages to pull the second half with the action scenes which was choreographed well. Music was also a neutral point for the film. Actors like Saritha (sivakarthikeyan's mother) and myskkin (villain) did a great job. Vijay Sethupathi's voice over was deeply engaging us, making us eager to know what he's gonna speak next. A cliched second half made this film weak yet it becomes one of the most creative subject in the tamil industry so far. Director Madonne Ashwin definitely needs a hats off. His guts to make a film like this and introduce this among the family audience of India, he did a great job. Overall a worthy cinematic experience which leaves you with a engaging plot and a unique concept in the Kollywood., First Half Blasted!!!! Theatre Erupted!!!!Three stages of SK life in movie
Coward ------&gt; Warrior -------&gt; The Great Warrior
This transformation was too good...Second half particular sequence, where Mysskin attacks SK and sk explains how he hearing voices and how he fights and thats one of my fav scene....Yogi Babu was phenomenal... The director used him very well... From start to end he never fails to make us laugh...Music was good.... Bgm is awesome and addictive...
Great writing and screenplay...Vijay Sethupathi's Voice is too good and elevated every scene.. He lived in this movie without even acting a single scene...Maaveeran..... The Great Film., Opening comic strip of a giant man - copied from "Attack on the titans" (Shingeki no Kyoujin), along with the action in the comic. Rajinikanth's iconic pole fight before home in Baasha is also copied, only difference is Manikkam asked his sister to go in and here, the people are asked not to go in(!)I do not know what to say... Korean films "Tower", "The Exit" and "Agent Jun" were copied a lot in the second half, particularly in the climax. Throughout, "Agent Jun" also seems to have influenced a lot. The one star is for the comedy with Yogi Babu who pulls some serious faces here. (Some YouTubers are also funny for a few minutes)The heroine is more like a waste baggage character, although the actress tries to act sometimes and fails. The entire sister's problem arc is unresolved, which is deeply disappointing and the film just keeps following random tracks behind a thin concept. This is not a super hero film, as no explanations or super powers exist. Maybe the message is to kill off the dreams of anyone who tries to make anime in India.The film is not worth the watch time and the action is awful... Particularly in the climax. All scenes are predictable and characters are one-dimensional. I do not understand why "Mandela" director made such a disaster. Maybe to pamper the actor's fans with a delusion that this is "mass". The one scene where the princess is sketched as the heroine is an utter flop, as the heroine looks worse than the previous sketch. Moreover, such "Kanni theevu" styles of sketches were dead a long time ago and at least the opening animation could have been new age for this budget. Where did the 85 crores go?!, Apart from the comedy sequences featuring Yogi Babu in the first half, there is nothing of comparable quality.(The reason of 3star goes to him)The second half, in particular, suffers from extremely poor execution and storyline.The filmmakers attempted to create a superhero film, but it ultimately turned out to be incredibly disappointing. I am at a loss for words to describe just how bad it is; it's simply a waste.I feel sorry for the lead actor for being associated with this movie, and the role of the female lead is yet another unnecessary addition.If you are someone who notices logical inconsistencies, I strongly advise staying away from this film as it is not suitable for you.Thanks for reading., Movie directly enters the plot of the story in the beginning itself and The 1st half is a slow burner but very good with good humour worked very well in the 1st half and the interval was quite good the real problem of the movie starts in the 2nd half of the film only it is completely collapsed very predicateble scenes designed and the climax was very bad...2nd half makes movie strictly AveragePerforme wise: sk tried something new working very well Yogi Babu super humour myskin ok Aditi decent sk mother goodCinematography/Action Scenes superbb

Story: Nice New to tamil cinema., First off - Hats off to Madonne Ashwin on bringing up a very important social controversy which would barely be considered by real life politicians, and that too, in a very intriguing way. The first half was really interesting and was worthy enough to keep our minds on the thrill for the second half. But what went wrong?Every mediocre Tamil movie always falls victim to the same problem - inconsistent writing and the impact it creates on the runtime of the movie. The film barely needed a romantic segment; and the part where SK stops hearing VJS' voice and goes back to living the normal life was not really necessary to the plot, as the story went elsewhere instead of being focused on saving the falling Makkal Maligai apartments. Myssskin tries his best to look vicious as the villain of the film, but fails to hit the mark. Plotholes started emerging from the depths of nowhere in the second half and suddenly at the climax, they revive SK who was trapped dead in a big apartment disaster. Yogi Babu had done really well with his comedic portions as usual.Despite everything, the movie has many moments that appeals the audience and makes us laugh. Overall, this film may have been boring, but Madonne Ashwin hardly fails in entertaining the viewers as a director, and could have done better considering how good his work was in Mandela. Solid entertainer that you can watch with your family and friends for a good time on a fine weekend., I thought it to be a comedy but it is not. The whole films revolves around the hero and the villain
With poor script , entire political system and politicians are corrupted but here the hero gets super power to kill one corrupt politicians as if the entire country depends on him and the entire country is those few poorly constructed buildings. Only saving grace are few comic moments of yogi , dance watched it with subtitles there is not much as visual for viewers who don't understand the language . There was no need of heroine totally wasted. Actor playing mother did her best apart from that the film's is slow unnecessarily stretched and the climax does not make any sense., On a warm Saturday, we remembered we haven't hit the theatres in a long time, checked all the nearby screenings and we chose to watch Maaveeran. We didn't have many expectations as the trailer pretty much summed up what we can expect from the film.Despite low expectations, Maveeran still sucked - thanks to its unoriginal screenplay. The cinematography and production quality were top notch - no arguments in that, but what is the use of such technical prowess, if the story that depicts is half baked, unimaginative and sterile?In a twisted turn of events, Sathya, a comic writer, starts hearing a voice that prompts his future. Born coward - Sathya struggles to weild this new power and does not put that into good use until the very end.What are the positives about this film?Cinematography &amp; the character arc of the main lead, Sathya along with the character of the minister's friend make the film interesting. 'Vannarapaetayila' - the song was already a success before the film's release. The film also stands true to its plot and doesn't divert from the core.What are the negatives about the film?Government migrates people from the slums to 'grand' apartments. Thanks to the fate of our country, we already know what would happen. And we predict that the building would collapse but it doesn't collapse until climax (which needs its own paragraph as it was a heart burning cliche)The humor is unfunny. We smile, but it is not rofl kind of laughter. Such a weak screenplay needed some comedy but the script and dialogues couldn't deliver it. The voice was irritating. Vijay Sethupathi couldn't talk in Sentamizh properly and especially during fight sequences, the additional background narration just agitated the audience.The script was weak. The writing was lazy and terrible. With the new found power of the main lead, they could have added so many interesting elements and made the film spicy but they stuck to the usual cliche which made the film boring and sleep inducing.As the end credits rolled, I wondered, so many people came together and worked hard to make this kuppai. Only if the script had some originality, how hard is to write, people?]
