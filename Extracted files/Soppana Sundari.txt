['', Some of those times when you really wish there was a rating below 1 is this one. Replace in the beginning and in the end when the main characters who are women, if made as men, will the movie be watchable ? If the cunning, conniving characters, who even kill their own father and sell off his organs, are let go scot free is considered as comedy is India or Tamil Nadu, then this movie is for you.Just answer when the movie is being watched, if there is any scene is comedy ? There might be a lot of scenes where the women are smart or over-smart is this movie. But beyond that, there wasn't much to watch in this movie.Start by making movies which try to boost the youngsters/oldmen or people in general without shouting or using bad words and can be watched by people across generations is what is desparately needed now.Ps : people(directors/producers) can claim these are already available in MGR movies and are not available now. What they lack to understand is that they're not able to make it applicable to this generation and not more. I'll still watch "varumayin niram sivappu" and "unnal mudiyum thambi" and "thamizhselvan" even though my brain wasn't even able to correspond what's said in those when they were released but i get goosebumps when i watch them today., I recently had the opportunity to watch the Tamil film "Soppana Sundari" released in 2023, written and directed by SG Charles, and starring Aishwarya Rajesh, Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli, Deepa Shankar, Karunakaran, and Sathish Krishnan. This dark comedy tells the story of a girl from a modest background who lives with her mother and mute sister. When this financially struggling family wins a $10 million car in a lottery, trouble starts when the eldest son claims to be the rightful winner. What follows is a series of dramatic and surprising twists as other people try to lay claim to the car.The strengths of the film are undoubtedly the humor and unexpected twists in the plot that made me jump in surprise multiple times. I also appreciate films centered around women that Aishwarya Rajesh has been recently part of, such as "Driver Jamuna" and "The Great Indian Kitchen", and "Soppana Sundari" is no exception. It's a delight to see her in a comedic role, and she delivers a strong performance in this film.However, a weakness of the film lies in the post-production work, particularly the issues with color grading and visual glitches at times. It's evident that some efforts were overlooked in this area, which can be disappointing for cinephiles who pay attention to these details.In conclusion, I had a good time watching "Soppana Sundari", and I would recommend this film to comedy fans who are looking for some light-hearted entertainment. I give it a rating of 8/10., RATED 6/10

Source: HotstarThe movie starts with some good vibes and the introduction of each character was nice. We can forgive the small small logic holes and enjoy the first half thoroughly.When the problem and situations are simple, the movie was good. When ti get thickens, the movie derailed and went into the masala mode...the rape sequence is worst among all the things in the last twenty minutes....The problems and reasons in the first half are not at all considered in the second half... the sister marriage, loan issues all are sidelined and comedy and heroine centric situations are taken as core....One time watchable.... nothing special., Family entertainment movie must watch everyone start to end nonstop laughing director and crew did good job üëèüëèüëè A decent movie with a good message. Laughed a lot while watching a movie after a long time as most of the movies these days are either thriller or serious types.

Simple but a great message from movie., We started watching Soppana Sundari not expecting anything but left really satisfied! The movie was fun containing many layers and carried us on a hilarious adventureDELICIOUS-Give it up to Deepa Shankar (playing Aishwarya's mother), there's no way you can forget her performance.

She was amusing, always murmuring something and worried about everything üòÇ-One thing that we extremely appreciated was the fighter spirit Aishwarya, her sister, and mother had. Tamil movies usually tend to portray female characters as weak and fearful. But not here, no matter the challenges thrown at them, no matter the amount of men attacking them, these women fought to their very best ability-The comedy was omnipresent and SG Charles' direction style was very intentional, he didn't waste time, as soon as the movie began, we were taken to the story's catalyst. Every character had their intended purpose. When we thought we figured it out, here came another twist, Well doneCan we ask for a sequel please?BLAND---The cinematography and art direction could have been elevated to complement the comic atmosphere. Their simplicity just made the movie appear casual., For a chill weekend, its a perfect watch to laugh out loud literally! Movie isn't slow and hits the pace as it starts and is funny. Some scenes are unnecessary but in the end makes it a satisfying watch.The lead cast especially Deepa is unforgettable. Aishwarya and Lakshmi Priya are in some good action form too - All 3 lead the film in the best way.Don't expect extraordinary out of this - it's a simple watch that will keep you hooked. Direction, screenplay, editing and cinematography make you feel the ordinary atmosphere the film takes you through and adds an intrigue throughout.Great job., "Soppana Sundari" is an absolute delight that left my family and me in splits! This hilarious film directed by SG Charles, with Aishwarya Rajesh leading in the front, offers a perfect blend of comedy, entertainment, and thrilling moments that made our weekend afternoon truly memorable.The movie's lighthearted narrative had us laughing from start to finish, with witty dialogues and impeccable comedic timing. The well-crafted humor appealed to both the younger and older generations, making it a wonderful experience to enjoy with family. It's a testament to the film's universal appeal that my mom, dad, and I all had a fantastic time together.One of the standout aspects of "Soppana Sundari" is its tasteful music, which beautifully complements the storyline. The songs are catchy, enjoyable, and seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhancing the overall experience. The background music, in particular, adds depth and intensity to key moments, creating an immersive atmosphere, contrasting to the comedic nature of the screenplay.Aishwarya Rajesh, in the lead role, delivers a sublime performance that showcases her versatility as an actress. Her comedic timing, expressive facial expressions, and natural charm make her portrayal of the titular character truly endearing.

Her impeccable comic timing and facial expressions add an extra layer of hilarity to the film.Overall, "Soppana Sundari" is a must-watch for anyone seeking a fun-filled and heartwarming cinematic experience.

Whether you're watching it with your family or friends, be prepared for a laugh riot that will leave you with a smile on your face long after the credits roll.]['', Some of those times when you really wish there was a rating below 1 is this one. Replace in the beginning and in the end when the main characters who are women, if made as men, will the movie be watchable ? If the cunning, conniving characters, who even kill their own father and sell off his organs, are let go scot free is considered as comedy is India or Tamil Nadu, then this movie is for you.Just answer when the movie is being watched, if there is any scene is comedy ? There might be a lot of scenes where the women are smart or over-smart is this movie. But beyond that, there wasn't much to watch in this movie.Start by making movies which try to boost the youngsters/oldmen or people in general without shouting or using bad words and can be watched by people across generations is what is desparately needed now.Ps : people(directors/producers) can claim these are already available in MGR movies and are not available now. What they lack to understand is that they're not able to make it applicable to this generation and not more. I'll still watch "varumayin niram sivappu" and "unnal mudiyum thambi" and "thamizhselvan" even though my brain wasn't even able to correspond what's said in those when they were released but i get goosebumps when i watch them today., I recently had the opportunity to watch the Tamil film "Soppana Sundari" released in 2023, written and directed by SG Charles, and starring Aishwarya Rajesh, Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli, Deepa Shankar, Karunakaran, and Sathish Krishnan. This dark comedy tells the story of a girl from a modest background who lives with her mother and mute sister. When this financially struggling family wins a $10 million car in a lottery, trouble starts when the eldest son claims to be the rightful winner. What follows is a series of dramatic and surprising twists as other people try to lay claim to the car.The strengths of the film are undoubtedly the humor and unexpected twists in the plot that made me jump in surprise multiple times. I also appreciate films centered around women that Aishwarya Rajesh has been recently part of, such as "Driver Jamuna" and "The Great Indian Kitchen", and "Soppana Sundari" is no exception. It's a delight to see her in a comedic role, and she delivers a strong performance in this film.However, a weakness of the film lies in the post-production work, particularly the issues with color grading and visual glitches at times. It's evident that some efforts were overlooked in this area, which can be disappointing for cinephiles who pay attention to these details.In conclusion, I had a good time watching "Soppana Sundari", and I would recommend this film to comedy fans who are looking for some light-hearted entertainment. I give it a rating of 8/10., RATED 6/10
