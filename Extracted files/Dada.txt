['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Grab your snacks sit back and enjoy this movie on prime or tamilrockers lol what ever floats your boat. Heroine can act and lip sync was on point which is rare in tamil cinema. The kid is a total natural and cutie., After separation of pregnant couple,their kid came under dad responsible and start to grown up....
At one situation divorced couple start to work together in same company...
Finally both are joining by understanding their situations...

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining. Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful.Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined. Overall, Dada is a passionate rollercoaster of emotions which will leave you in a state of catharsis and will give you moments of joy that brings out a wider smile everytime.What's Good?A Remarkable script and stimulating screenplayTop Notch directionLaudable Performances from Kavin and Aparna and their organic chemistryMultiple Heart-warming and Heart-rending momentsJen Martin's magical compositionsWhat's Bad?The second half is a bit stretched and cliched with forced humour moments which could have easily be trimmed.Why should you stream?If you like the joys of watching feel good films which make you emotional and at times bring you a smile, stream Dada on Amazon Prime right now., Watched with out any expectation, nice a very good movie. The way Kavin and Aprana expressing love is real. No over acting, no over dialogue . Very matured performance. That is it. Super.I can connect me with so many things happen in the movie.Kavin is apt for this character. Screen play from the frame one is very different. Not going with regular flashback stories. No villain atrocities. This is straight forward and no loop wholes.A good emotional ride. It is just a life journey with twists all around. Climax is very simple and super. Going to watch again. It deserves a good Rating here. Must watch movie., Very nicely made movie with practical &amp; realistic dialogues. Leads actors have done a fantastic work. Hats off to the entire team who made this movie. Emotional, touching the father's love and very good happy ending.Need more such good movies.There is great dearth of such good family oriented movies.No BIG stars, no MASALA songs, no FIGHTS, no CINEMATIC elements, yet it is so gripping throughout the movie.Kid is so cute and lovable.Good editing, no unnecessary scenes. Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year.

What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster.

I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Grab your snacks sit back and enjoy this movie on prime or tamilrockers lol what ever floats your boat. Heroine can act and lip sync was on point which is rare in tamil cinema. The kid is a total natural and cutie., After separation of pregnant couple,their kid came under dad responsible and start to grown up....

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining. Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful.Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined. Overall, Dada is a passionate rollercoaster of emotions which will leave you in a state of catharsis and will give you moments of joy that brings out a wider smile everytime.What's Good?A Remarkable script and stimulating screenplayTop Notch directionLaudable Performances from Kavin and Aparna and their organic chemistryMultiple Heart-warming and Heart-rending momentsJen Martin's magical compositionsWhat's Bad?The second half is a bit stretched and cliched with forced humour moments which could have easily be trimmed.Why should you stream?If you like the joys of watching feel good films which make you emotional and at times bring you a smile, stream Dada on Amazon Prime right now., Watched with out any expectation, nice a very good movie. The way Kavin and Aprana expressing love is real. No over acting, no over dialogue . Very matured performance. That is it. Super.I can connect me with so many things happen in the movie.Kavin is apt for this character. Screen play from the frame one is very different. Not going with regular flashback stories. No villain atrocities. This is straight forward and no loop wholes.A good emotional ride. It is just a life journey with twists all around. Climax is very simple and super. Going to watch again. It deserves a good Rating here. Must watch movie., Very nicely made movie with practical &amp; realistic dialogues. Leads actors have done a fantastic work. Hats off to the entire team who made this movie. Emotional, touching the father's love and very good happy ending.Need more such good movies.There is great dearth of such good family oriented movies.No BIG stars, no MASALA songs, no FIGHTS, no CINEMATIC elements, yet it is so gripping throughout the movie.Kid is so cute and lovable.Good editing, no unnecessary scenes.

Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu.

Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen.

I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10.

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters .

Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining.

This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining. Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful., It's a wonderful movie with a deep storyline.Emotional and talks on reality of most modern parenting and youth. A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu.

This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining. Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful., It's a wonderful movie with a deep storyline.Emotional and talks on reality of most modern parenting and youth. A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined.

The way Kavin and Aprana expressing love is real. No over acting, no over dialogue . Very matured performance. That is it.

Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good .

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half.

Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places .

Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful., It's a wonderful movie with a deep storyline.Emotional and talks on reality of most modern parenting and youth. A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined. Overall, Dada is a passionate rollercoaster of emotions which will leave you in a state of catharsis and will give you moments of joy that brings out a wider smile everytime.What's Good?A Remarkable script and stimulating screenplayTop Notch directionLaudable Performances from Kavin and Aparna and their organic chemistryMultiple Heart-warming and Heart-rending momentsJen Martin's magical compositionsWhat's Bad?The second half is a bit stretched and cliched with forced humour moments which could have easily be trimmed.Why should you stream?If you like the joys of watching feel good films which make you emotional and at times bring you a smile, stream Dada on Amazon Prime right now., Watched with out any expectation, nice a very good movie. The way Kavin and Aprana expressing love is real. No over acting, no over dialogue . Very matured performance. That is it. Super.I can connect me with so many things happen in the movie.Kavin is apt for this character. Screen play from the frame one is very different. Not going with regular flashback stories.

Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good .

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story

Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie .

Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined.

What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good.

It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all.

Solid performance from the lead actors.

Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times.

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie .

Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining.

A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined.

Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Grab your snacks sit back and enjoy this movie on prime or tamilrockers lol what ever floats your boat. Heroine can act and lip sync was on point which is rare in tamil cinema. The kid is a total natural and cutie., After separation of pregnant couple,their kid came under dad responsible and start to grown up....

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory.

The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much.

Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Grab your snacks sit back and enjoy this movie on prime or tamilrockers lol what ever floats your boat. Heroine can act and lip sync was on point which is rare in tamil cinema. The kid is a total natural and cutie., After separation of pregnant couple,their kid came under dad responsible and start to grown up....

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining.

Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined. Overall, Dada is a passionate rollercoaster of emotions which will leave you in a state of catharsis and will give you moments of joy that brings out a wider smile everytime.What's Good?A Remarkable script and stimulating screenplayTop Notch directionLaudable Performances from Kavin and Aparna and their organic chemistryMultiple Heart-warming and Heart-rending momentsJen Martin's magical compositionsWhat's Bad?The second half is a bit stretched and cliched with forced humour moments which could have easily be trimmed.Why should you stream?If you like the joys of watching feel good films which make you emotional and at times bring you a smile, stream Dada on Amazon Prime right now., Watched with out any expectation, nice a very good movie. The way Kavin and Aprana expressing love is real. No over acting, no over dialogue . Very matured performance. That is it. Super.I can connect me with so many things happen in the movie.Kavin is apt for this character. Screen play from the frame one is very different. Not going with regular flashback stories. No villain atrocities. This is straight forward and no loop wholes.A good emotional ride. It is just a life journey with twists all around. Climax is very simple and super. Going to watch again. It deserves a good Rating here. Must watch movie., Very nicely made movie with practical &amp; realistic dialogues. Leads actors have done a fantastic work. Hats off to the entire team who made this movie. Emotional, touching the father's love and very good happy ending.Need more such good movies.There is great dearth of such good family oriented movies.No BIG stars, no MASALA songs, no FIGHTS, no CINEMATIC elements, yet it is so gripping throughout the movie.Kid is so cute and lovable.Good editing, no unnecessary scenes. Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all.

Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Grab your snacks sit back and enjoy this movie on prime or tamilrockers lol what ever floats your boat. Heroine can act and lip sync was on point which is rare in tamil cinema.

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining. Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful.Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful., It's a wonderful movie with a deep storyline.Emotional and talks on reality of most modern parenting and youth. A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined.

I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined.

What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10.

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places .

Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining. Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful.Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie.

Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

Don't waste your time with this nonsense, watching paint dry is less painful., It's a wonderful movie with a deep storyline.Emotional and talks on reality of most modern parenting and youth. A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined. Overall, Dada is a passionate rollercoaster of emotions which will leave you in a state of catharsis and will give you moments of joy that brings out a wider smile everytime.What's Good?A Remarkable script and stimulating screenplayTop Notch directionLaudable Performances from Kavin and Aparna and their organic chemistryMultiple Heart-warming and Heart-rending momentsJen Martin's magical compositionsWhat's Bad?The second half is a bit stretched and cliched with forced humour moments which could have easily be trimmed.Why should you stream?If you like the joys of watching feel good films which make you emotional and at times bring you a smile, stream Dada on Amazon Prime right now., Watched with out any expectation, nice a very good movie. The way Kavin and Aprana expressing love is real. No over acting, no over dialogue . Very matured performance. That is it. Super.I can connect me with so many things happen in the movie.Kavin is apt for this character. Screen play from the frame one is very different. Not going with regular flashback stories.

Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good .

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay.

Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out?

Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined.

What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good.

It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all.

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie .

It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining.

A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined.

Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year. Solid performance from the lead actors. Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Grab your snacks sit back and enjoy this movie on prime or tamilrockers lol what ever floats your boat. Heroine can act and lip sync was on point which is rare in tamil cinema. The kid is a total natural and cutie., After separation of pregnant couple,their kid came under dad responsible and start to grown up....

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much.

Amazing story and screenplay combined with effortless performance from the Actors.Though the screen play appears to be slow during the 1st half of the movie.... It was gripping enough for the Audience to not get bored. Definitely a must watch movie if you want to experience ah feel good emotions at the end of a movie.I've watched the movie twice so far and was filled with emotions both the times. This is an amazing creation from a young team. Tamil cinema please make use of such artists and technicians., Coming of age movie...I liked it . The two leads were very apt in their roles. Kavin is a natural performer. The role had alot of scope for him to perform and he used it wisely. All in all ingredients needed for a feel good film is here. Music was good humor was also good . Story screenplay all superb. A bit lack in some character depths hence why the 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Grab your snacks sit back and enjoy this movie on prime or tamilrockers lol what ever floats your boat. Heroine can act and lip sync was on point which is rare in tamil cinema. The kid is a total natural and cutie., After separation of pregnant couple,their kid came under dad responsible and start to grown up....

Must watch emotional drama...!!, Who is Kavin guy? Excellent performance. Later learned, big boss and tv series popular actor. He is just keeping the movie going with his performance. A simple 1-line wvwnt in a Baghyaraj style movie, made into a feature film. Good direction, camera, music. Worth a watch.The first scene in the bed, next scene crying, next pregnancy. Movie seem to moves fast with events but nothing unexpected still worth a watch. Director avoided unnecessary parents sentiment but not sure why he had let aiswariya talk so much. The only most irritating character. Bhyagaraj done great üëçClimax, nothing extraordinary but with both their performance and mutual understanding without dialog makes it memorable., This is not a love story but a terrific emotional rollercoaster movie that greatly works because of the casting and characterization of the 2 leads. The screenplay is commendable with intersting choices - an intense sorrowful first half followed by an entertaining comedic second half, which is unusual for a love story.The Director has to be credited for a fantastic visual screenplay for this kind of film. It could easily not have worked and looked repetitive in many places, but the visual portrayal is too good and keeps you engaged.The protagonist is practical and is just the way till the end. May be this is what would have happened had Arjun Reddy married Priya. Do watch!!!, Dada rides on the fantastic performances of Kavin and Aparna, a screenplay that adds interesting touches to the a somewhat derivative plot, and soulful music ("Pogathey" is exceptional) &amp; lyrics. The leads shine as the young-lovers-turned-unexpected-parents, and the writing treats the characters of Sindhu and Manikandan with dignity. Scenes heavy on sentiment are carefully penned and enacted without delving into melodramatic territory. To add to that, there are solid supporting acts by Harish K (who plays Mani's friend Amit), Arvind Ezhilarasan, and a few others. The occasional one-liners also manage to tickle the funny bone.Writer-director Ganesh K. Babu exhibits conviction in the way he handles the dramatic scenes in the first half. The second half, however, is a bit of a different story. Mani's struggles in bringing up an infant are brushed aside to include his job hunt (which relies too heavily on the luck factor), and certain elements and subplots are introduced that really do not mean much. I also didn't enjoy the stereotyping of the colleagues and bosses; they served no purpose than to bring the couple back together in a contrived and stretched way. The quintessential reunion scene is wonderfully executed, and it ensures that audiences leave on a happy note!, Dada deals with Mani &amp; Sindhu who have an unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock. Abandoned by their respective families, the couple are forced to live on their own. The challenges they face as a couple, going through the pregnancy together, eventually leads to Sindhu leaving Mani &amp; their newborn child at the hospital post delivery. This forces Mani to be a single father, overcoming all odds to raise his child. What happens when he eventually come across Sindhu forms rest of the story.The writing and direction needs to be praised for sensibly handling this subject without showing anyone in negative shade. Mani's inability to handle his new found responsibility towards his pregnant partner is shown well without going overboard and even Sindhu's decision to leave him almost feels justified without turning her into a villain. This firmly establishes the story and the second act entirely gives a feel good drama that largely works for the lead actors' charm as well as the credible support from the supporting cast.The climax has a hard hitting scene but it's impact is immediately toned down with that convenient twist in the end. Sure, it is one way to get the happy ending but the build up till that moment loses it's pay off as the characters themselves stood out with a decent arcs. Apart from this, the film still offers a lot of lighthearted moments, making it a worthy watch. Once again, kudos to Kavin &amp; Aparna Das for coming up with really good performances that made this film special., OMG....thats y u need character from TV who can put all the effort in better way....what a movie what a feeling....no over talking, no over drama, no over emotional.....the moment when mother meets his kid is the best in the movie where no overacting has been done.His is exactly what I felt while watching the movie . But when we see the public reviews 70 percentage of them said the 2nd half was best . Frst half was decent . This states Many people are still in the commercial world of cinema. Until they change directors won't change their perspective of making so called commercial cinema .Thanks whole DADA crew., A emotional feel good drama .Pros - Fine story for a feel good movie and intresting one . Major positive was making style , Ganesh K Babu in his debut did a great job in direction especially keeping things simple and subtle . Emotional part were another great pillar to the movie , especially a orphanage sequence in 1st half and climax were tear-jerker . Comedy worked well in most of the places . Interesting characters and there is no good or bad potrayal every characters has its own flaws , their character arc were good . Actors justified their respective characters . Technically , cinematography was good . Music was splendid but songs were average .Cons - 2nd half bit lagged in narration comparing to the first , but climax somehow compensates this flaw . Editing and dubbing in few places were odd .Overall a good emotional feel good drama to watch . A perfect movie for the Valentine's week , yes it's not a romance drama but worthy movie to watch with your partner ., The movie is telling a simple story which can be anyone of our life story but the elevation of the movie was acting and music. Also Director knew what to give in screen so it really connects with us. I was one of the people was not able leave the theatre at climax they made me so emotional that I wanted to see more from there.The story revolves around hero and heroine but also gives enough space to all other characters. Some characters just give hope that maybe our life would be lot better if we too get that characters in our life.Music was also a lead in the story
Without any spoilers of content but there are scenes where the artists perform so splendidly and meaningful to scene
Autokaran anna Without any dialogue scored for me., A really dragging drastic realistic drama. The positives are the film is really being realistic and so real to the current situation. There are many other films like this in the past like adhalal kadhal seyveer so nothing new. Even tat film was was so real but this one had a commercial end. The film was really dragging and the climax was fixed after the firat scen showcased. There was a bit comedy in the middle. This may hit people who are single father. But i couldnt personally connect a bit. Kavin did his role to the best his acting skills has been top notch but could have selected a better stroy to do so. The movie has a good story with bad screenplay. Music was killing overall a one timw watchable film., This is probably a 2K kids-based story since it involves premature sex &amp; pregnancy, recently this is becoming a trend after love today.The film has a very usual plot and you'd almost guess every single next move by most characters &amp; the ML model in your brain would so easily predict the next scene and so on, yet, there are few tweaks or making a style that captures your attention and gives a fresh feel &amp; looks to every scene with shuttle funny/mocking dialogues, every single/side characters' performance &amp; delivery, frame, lighting, though most of the scenes are long shot scenes and feels a bit like director Nelson kinda film-making, yet, the film just pulls you into its universe and you just travel along without getting bored much, that IMO is a perfect film making.For a creator, making this kinda film is so risky because even a few messes could turn down the overall mood of the audience but overall, the film takes us, the audience through a smooth journey by keeping tabs on our mood of ours every now &amp; then which makes this film not just watchable but interesting one as well and for those light-hearted ones, this is a must watch because I saw so many people literally crying out in the theatres, it was so surreal to watch people getting emoted to such levels.Kavin's characterization was really well designed and literally lives through the life of that character showcasing how a man survives in this economy as a single parent, which is the underlying foundational theme of this whole film.There are certainly multiple flaws in this film but all those flaws get covered up with shuttle reactions/emotions &amp; funny sequences.If you're an avid moviegoer, then you should not miss the theatrical experience., Does all of India upvote this garbage every time a movie comes out? This was utter nonsense and it was way too long and too slowly paced. Reading the bogus reviews were more entertaining.

A sense we must all have on the repercussions of misleading are emotions.The storyline is unique and you would get a sense if watching a fresh movie after a damn long time in tamil cinema.Glad to see such nice moving coming out and it's simple with a great message being driven out to wider audience.Indeed a good movie to be watched by all. Enterntainer and nice acting by kavin and rest.The emotional scenes are well dealt without any cringes.Realistic and good movie to watch., Nice movie. At begining of the movie it was little laggy but later on the movie picked up the speed and the story telling was nice. Totally a feel good movie. At each section of the movie, i wondered how they going to continue from here on because it will come to a complicated point. But the director did well to tell us the story. From the complication it will go to next level and next level and it never ends until the movie really ends. I like the simplicity in the movie, a Father's love was highlighted well without upsetting the mother's love. Sweet. Again i would highlight; this is a feel good movie. Everyone must watch. I believe everyone will enjoy it as much as i did., A very nice emotional movie with humor which touched all our hearts. Kavin acting is too good and some scenes were so emotional. Aparna das acting is also good and I liked it. The humor with the office colleagues is well placed in the movie which gave good laughing moments in the middle of emotional story. Vtv Ganesh has a nice character in this movie. Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future., One of the best heart touching movie in recent times in Indian cinema. The screenplay from the start is very good. It shows the transformation of a teen into a responsible father under unexpected situations. The way the director dealt with the teenage love story and unexpected pregnancy to growing a child without mother in such a tender age shows the growing maturity of the hero. The movie revolves around the struggles faced by the teen father in raising a child with limited income. It shows the reality of society how people try to destroy others growth. It is mixed with all emotions. Very well directed movie. Hero and heroine chemistry is great they lived in their characters. Must watch !!!, To be honest, i didn't have any high hopes for this film. Mostly new comers and a new director. I was pleasantly surprised. The technical aspects of the story like screenplay, cast, editing were all top notch. The movie talks about how life changes when you make mistakes. Father son relationship is just a part in this movie, there are much more life lessons in this movie. I would say it's more a coming of age story. Harsh realities of life are portrayed with a touch of humor. The lead characters did a great job. They were all very subtle and not too dramatic. The friends all were very convincing in their roles, especially Amit and Saravanan. Though the plot is a familiar one it is not a regular movie with cliches and cheesy dialogues. I would definitely recommend watching this., Kavin shines in this impassioned tale of a father's stirring journey.Dada is a poignant and moving journey of single dad which is beautifully written and directed by Ganesh K Babu. With a stimulating screenplay, earnest performances from the leads, multiple heartfelt moments and profound music Dada is film which stays with you a bit longer than you may have imagined. Overall, Dada is a passionate rollercoaster of emotions which will leave you in a state of catharsis and will give you moments of joy that brings out a wider smile everytime.What's Good?A Remarkable script and stimulating screenplayTop Notch directionLaudable Performances from Kavin and Aparna and their organic chemistryMultiple Heart-warming and Heart-rending momentsJen Martin's magical compositionsWhat's Bad?The second half is a bit stretched and cliched with forced humour moments which could have easily be trimmed.Why should you stream?If you like the joys of watching feel good films which make you emotional and at times bring you a smile, stream Dada on Amazon Prime right now., Watched with out any expectation, nice a very good movie. The way Kavin and Aprana expressing love is real. No over acting, no over dialogue . Very matured performance. That is it. Super.I can connect me with so many things happen in the movie.Kavin is apt for this character. Screen play from the frame one is very different. Not going with regular flashback stories. No villain atrocities. This is straight forward and no loop wholes.A good emotional ride. It is just a life journey with twists all around. Climax is very simple and super. Going to watch again. It deserves a good Rating here. Must watch movie., Very nicely made movie with practical &amp; realistic dialogues. Leads actors have done a fantastic work. Hats off to the entire team who made this movie. Emotional, touching the father's love and very good happy ending.Need more such good movies.There is great dearth of such good family oriented movies.No BIG stars, no MASALA songs, no FIGHTS, no CINEMATIC elements, yet it is so gripping throughout the movie.Kid is so cute and lovable.Good editing, no unnecessary scenes. Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]['', Dada will definitely be one of the well made movies in Tamil cinemas this year.

Emotional, touching the father's love and very good happy ending.Need more such good movies.There is great dearth of such good family oriented movies.No BIG stars, no MASALA songs, no FIGHTS, no CINEMATIC elements, yet it is so gripping throughout the movie.Kid is so cute and lovable.Good editing, no unnecessary scenes. Only reqd moments for the story alone retained.Apt background score, nothing disturbing or distracting, goes with the emotions of the movie., Movie is good.. Screenplay is good. What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen. But due too poor performance it could not bring expected impact in the movie.., This is one of the best feel good movies i have ever watched. Everything about this movie is so good. The actors did their job so so well that some scenes actually brings tears in your eyes.The story,the concept everything is something which we have seen before but this movie is made so beautifully that it just doesn't matter...
From the beginning we are hooked into the movie.its an emotional rollercoaster. The chemistry between the father and the son is shown very beautifully.I would say you people should just go and watch this movie without even thinking whether it would be good. I can assure you that you won't regret., First 40 minutes are boring but after that movie is good , very realistic and feel good movie . It can also be told as best movie of the month .Dadaa and aparna das characters are amazing .Dadaa father who is very cool and dadaas mother and friends have also played realistic character.His struggles from giving a baby to orphage till rising him and turn of events that take place in dada's life makes it worth to watch dadaa.Moreover it's a must watch feel good movie for family ,as well as very realistic songs and corporate environment is shown .Want to see this movie win big awards in future and dadaa 2., Dada is a very average movie , there is no logic behind any scene , if it was a comedy movie then u won't expect logic this movie has to do more with emotion but dosent connect at all. Movie like theri showcased the father child relationship very well. Here the child artist has acted well but doesn't have the screen space . He came for over all 15-20 min . Don't go for this movie looking at the reviews.it was a big let down for me I would rate this movie 5 out of 10.Butthey could have handle this story better but they failed to do so but was not boring can watch once on TV or when it comes.z.]
