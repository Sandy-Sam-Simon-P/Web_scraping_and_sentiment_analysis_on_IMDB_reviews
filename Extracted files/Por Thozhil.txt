Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end . Everything and every reference in the movie made sense , even small details never fails to pay off .

Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life.

Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay .

Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming.

A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end . Everything and every reference in the movie made sense , even small details never fails to pay off . Characters were well written especially Sarath Kumar as senior arrogant cop , on other side Ashok Selvan as junior chicken hearted cop , both their characters were neatly designed . Vignesh Raja's making was good , actually felt like a horror , some of the jumpscares worked well . Background scores were decent . Technically sounding good .Overall , a gripping and intriguing investigation thriller to watch . As a fan of this genre I thought it may be cliche but it's completely surprised me with it's writing . This movie has a great potential to be a franchise , I hope they do it . Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie. Though it seemed that the suspence thriller movie solved a serial murder mystery half way but the real suspence started then only. Loved the twist and loved the ending. Loved the complete entire movie. Its highly recommended movie,streaming on Sony Liv. Do watch it wherever you get time. I bet you will love it right from the start till end.]['', A rivetting journey of crime thriller that keeps u edge of seat untill the last act...with a brilliant story screenplay and fine performance from the cast the flick has garnered all-round accolades...
Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil

This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end .

Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation.

I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay .

Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie. Though it seemed that the suspence thriller movie solved a serial murder mystery half way but the real suspence started then only. Loved the twist and loved the ending. Loved the complete entire movie. Its highly recommended movie,streaming on Sony Liv. Do watch it wherever you get time. I bet you will love it right from the start till end.]['', A rivetting journey of crime thriller that keeps u edge of seat untill the last act...with a brilliant story screenplay and fine performance from the cast the flick has garnered all-round accolades...
Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...

Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end . Everything and every reference in the movie made sense , even small details never fails to pay off .

Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life.

What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay .

Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming.

A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end . Everything and every reference in the movie made sense , even small details never fails to pay off . Characters were well written especially Sarath Kumar as senior arrogant cop , on other side Ashok Selvan as junior chicken hearted cop , both their characters were neatly designed . Vignesh Raja's making was good , actually felt like a horror , some of the jumpscares worked well . Background scores were decent . Technically sounding good .Overall , a gripping and intriguing investigation thriller to watch . As a fan of this genre I thought it may be cliche but it's completely surprised me with it's writing . This movie has a great potential to be a franchise , I hope they do it . Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie. Though it seemed that the suspence thriller movie solved a serial murder mystery half way but the real suspence started then only. Loved the twist and loved the ending. Loved the complete entire movie. Its highly recommended movie,streaming on Sony Liv. Do watch it wherever you get time. I bet you will love it right from the start till end.]['', A rivetting journey of crime thriller that keeps u edge of seat untill the last act...with a brilliant story screenplay and fine performance from the cast the flick has garnered all-round accolades...
Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil

This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end .

Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation.

I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay .

Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie. Though it seemed that the suspence thriller movie solved a serial murder mystery half way but the real suspence started then only. Loved the twist and loved the ending. Loved the complete entire movie. Its highly recommended movie,streaming on Sony Liv. Do watch it wherever you get time. I bet you will love it right from the start till end.]['', A rivetting journey of crime thriller that keeps u edge of seat untill the last act...with a brilliant story screenplay and fine performance from the cast the flick has garnered all-round accolades...
Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...

Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end . Everything and every reference in the movie made sense , even small details never fails to pay off .

Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life.

What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay .

Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming.

A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end . Everything and every reference in the movie made sense , even small details never fails to pay off . Characters were well written especially Sarath Kumar as senior arrogant cop , on other side Ashok Selvan as junior chicken hearted cop , both their characters were neatly designed . Vignesh Raja's making was good , actually felt like a horror , some of the jumpscares worked well . Background scores were decent . Technically sounding good .Overall , a gripping and intriguing investigation thriller to watch . As a fan of this genre I thought it may be cliche but it's completely surprised me with it's writing . This movie has a great potential to be a franchise , I hope they do it . Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie. Though it seemed that the suspence thriller movie solved a serial murder mystery half way but the real suspence started then only. Loved the twist and loved the ending. Loved the complete entire movie. Its highly recommended movie,streaming on Sony Liv. Do watch it wherever you get time. I bet you will love it right from the start till end.]['', A rivetting journey of crime thriller that keeps u edge of seat untill the last act...with a brilliant story screenplay and fine performance from the cast the flick has garnered all-round accolades...
Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil

This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end .

Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation.

I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay .

Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life. Watched it without any expectation while searching a time pass movie on Sony Liv but trust me it turned out my best decision. What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie. Though it seemed that the suspence thriller movie solved a serial murder mystery half way but the real suspence started then only. Loved the twist and loved the ending. Loved the complete entire movie. Its highly recommended movie,streaming on Sony Liv. Do watch it wherever you get time. I bet you will love it right from the start till end.]['', A rivetting journey of crime thriller that keeps u edge of seat untill the last act...with a brilliant story screenplay and fine performance from the cast the flick has garnered all-round accolades...
Vignesh raja explores the realities of police job simultaneously livelihood of individuals at proper intervals where the characters are caught in a vortex of survival and desperate measures they take on and consequences sets the benchmark for Kollywood post "RATCHASAN"...
While compelling narratives are supported by evocative camera work and bgm keeps u in a web of deceit and compliments the narration ...
Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...

Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...

Overall a worthy theatrical movie that deserves a nationwide recognition..., Por Thozhil is about a newly recruited DSP trainee Prakash (Ashok Selvan) teaming up with seasoned officer SP Lokanathan (Sarath Kumar) over a serial killing case. Lokanathan is least interested in mentoring the rookie and the rookie decides to prove himself by helping Lokanathan solve the case. A series of murders happen with the perpetrator leaving no clue and randomly choosing the victims. How the duo find the real killer when they have literally no motive to work with forms the story.Por Thozhil solely works for it's writing which gives no space to deviate from it's limited set of characters and their sub plots. Kudos to the director for keeping proceedings tense and especially the first half simply stands out with that terrific interval block. The subtle treatment does the trick and having seasoned actors like Sarath Babu and Sarath Kumar is a casting masterstroke. The second half though doesn't match the first half which had set the bar too high, it still delivers with the rightly placed twists despite choosing the predictable narrative.With strong performances and a tight narrative, Por Thozhil is another worthy entry into the investigative thriller genre and is worth watching. Definitely recommended., This film feels like one of the best crime novel-based films ever made.The 2 protagonists based crime investigation drama in Tamil films is rarely made and the twists &amp; turns in the film are so engaging with a back plot for every character and made in a not-so-boring way is really intriguing to watch.The unfolding of every single scene from the start to the end of the film with a nicely designed characterisation makes this film a must-watch for all crime moviegoers.After a long time, Sarath Kumar has done a role that showcases how good a senior actor he is.Overall, this film is a bliss to watch, if you like watching crime investigation thrillers., A well written &amp; well made engaging edge of the seat crime thriller by Vignesh Raja. The first half was superb, and the second half was extraordinary. The last 45 minutes were unpredictable, with twists &amp; turns. The killer's motive was well executed through flashback, and his sad moments were portrayed good. The duo of Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan was absolutely phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact throughout the movie. Sarath Kumar played his cop role perfectly, showcasing boldness and brilliance. The way his character was explained in the last scene, within a single scene, was truly great. The character growth of Ashok Selvan from the beginning to the end was Impressive, his last gun scene was outstanding. Cinematography was excellent. The Background Music was absolutely perfect, creating thrilling moments. Overall, "Por Thozil" offers a great experience that does not disappoint., All aspiring filmmakers should take some notes; crime novelists could take a couple of lessons as well; this is how tales of crime should be adapted into compelling screenplays, and this is how crime thrillers should be concocted.What an immaculate work; albeit I was already aware of its encouraging reception, it still managed to leave a lingering impression.One of the main reasons being its neat writing which wasted no time in trifling worries and refrained from indulging in unnecessary subplots; the script, from beginning to end, stayed very much to the point and seldom detracted from its intended course, which I admired.Other than its writing mastery, the performances too had their significant contributions; both the leads did great in their respective positions, and they had to gel well together, and they did, which in return produced more anticipation for the viewers; it made things more memorable, I reckon., I would like to hurry recommend this week engaging thriller gripping screenplay and I never seen this type of thriller in Tamil cinema in recent times. Both the actress did very well specially Sharad Kumar did brilliant. Story telling screenplay cinematography and background drama looks very nice. Keeping this suspense and pattern very well and direction will give you high points it would be my personal favourite now you can watch it in on Sony LIV. Murder mystery and engaging drama would feel best among the suspense thriller. It's highly recommending now. I am expecting more Tamil movies like this., Por Thozil
A review by Rajesh Puvvada 11th June 2023It's been while since I have watched a movie where every sentence spoken and every shot taken has complete relevance. The plot and presentation is so handsome that the looks of actors are of no purpose in this movie.Crime and serial killing stories are not new, but how the movie is presented makes a whole difference. It's a typical story with a veteran and rookie gap in understanding is wide and the grumpy veteran has an edge backed by experience.By far Sharath Kumar's most meaningful no nonsense performance. Ashok Selvan fits very well within the plot and delivers his part without blemish. I must say with his performance he has come of age in Tamil cinema. You get to see Sarath Babu for one last time in this movie. The quaint septuagenarian has delivered and that was noteworthy.The movie spins around a few roads in Trichy. No long chases, unnecessary build ups, six pack glamour. There is so much realism in this movie, one will appreciate the colloquial flavour the movie keeps.The movie leaves a message to all those parents who fail to offer a proper childhood to their children. So it's a must watch for all the parents. The mortuary scenes can be disturbing, hence I would recommend to leave the young children away from this movie.I am going with a 8.8/10 for this one. Do watch it!! Some can wait for the OTT release, but you will miss the completeness a theatre would offer generously!!I am planning to watch it again, to analyse the presentation style!!, Por Thozhil- Cliff edge and fast paced crime investigative thriller. It pounds back heart at rapid pace with depth in the story and crisp editing. Hats off to the amazing Director Vignesh Raja who raises the bar on how to take quality movies, keeping audience at the edge with every moment and make it realistic. No songs, no masala and no unnecessary scenes. Dialogues are to the point and screenplay is super sleek. Sharath Kumar is apt to the role with serious acting. Ashok Selvan does the job well. Antagonist gives shivers down the spine. Background music is top notch and gels really well with the story. One of the best Tamil thrillers and even surpasses Ratsasan. Watch it only in theatre as it's totally worth it!, A senior and junior police officers Try to finding a serial killer and by their talent investigation they caught the killers finally...
Very gripping screenplay and scenes...

Very gripping screenplay and scenes...
Climax little resemblance of 'The silence of the lambs'...!Must watch investigation thriller..!, "Child is the father of man"- This is a famous quote from William Wordsworth and this quote perfectly suits this movie. I couldn't watch it in theaters because it was not released in a theatre near my home. This is the best Tamil thriller of 2023 thanks to its crisp and clear screenplay.I was so excited to see Sharath Kumar after a long time. He and Sharath Babu are the top performers in this movie. The production design was also fine and the camera department also did a great job. I'm expecting more thrillers like this in the coming years from Tollywood, this was mind-blowing and the twist in the movie was great than I expected., Watched without any expectations but it was a great thriller ride without any flaw
It was crisp...
Actors justified their roles obviously it was Ashok Selvan and Sharath Kumar
Background music was great
No unnecessary songs and distractions
Some comedy worked out...
Twists was not forced
Even had a good message
Antagonists backstory was good
So everything was perfect
A good treat for thriller genre fans
I liked it for sure you may also like give it a try...
My rating to this movie is 9/10
Some disturbing scenes but family watchable...
Don't miss it in theatres and regret it later...
I hope it was helpful. Thank you..., ' Por Thozhil ' is a beautifully and carefully packed present with a satisfying gift inside.This movie not only gives you the thrills and goosebumps, it also deliveries a fair share of good laughable comedy and as a cherry on the top a bit a romance. It has a bit of every genre.The characters in this movie were very much realistic, and the actors had nailed their job at giving the characters' lives.This movie is perfect in its own way, given the fact that this is the director's first major movie, he did an amazing job.Vignesh Raja (the director), a tremendous applause to him as well as the entire team behind Por Thozhil.A must watch; it's such an incredible experience., Firstly, I am not the target audience here. I am a Telugu speaking person. I have picked this movie to watch only because I am a fan of this genre.The first half is great. Classic crime investigation stuff. The second half is good too. The graph dropped a bit after the flash back in the second half which is followed by a decent climax.If you are expecting something on a level of Ratsasan, you will be disappointed for sure. Not sure why everybody is comparing this movie with Ratsasan.However, if you are interested in this movie, you can definitely give it a shot - be it in theatre or on OTT., Not a genuine film, although has many twists and turns, with a lot of thrilling spots.Unfortunately, has many "comedy" scenes which make us angry, and questions the credibility of the film.. This is not a good film, in spirit.. A murder suspect by the name similar to real life accused Ramkumar, is shown to have committed suicide in custody and died. This is later shown to be the false killer, thereby lending support to rumors that Ramkumar was not the real Nungambakkam murderer. Decide if you want to support this or not.The Asok character has a flashback which makes one cringe.. Even in high school, one cannot narrate this "stone in manga tree and thief" story and get away without getting trolled. Some details they keep saying are not realistic and just falls into the "convenient for story's sake" trope.. This movie is not only low in budget, but in morals too.. The vilification of minorities and charities is done in a very open manner without repercussions., A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer! Starts with a captivating storyline n holds its grip until the half but suddenly disappoints by revealing the serial killer half way. Then usual crap flashback story to serial killer which makes no sense to his acts. No songs, no comedy, no unwanted drama definitely. But definitely could have been much better. Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!A crime suspense thriller about a serial killer!

Lead cast have played well. My ratings 6.5/10!, The movie is a police investigative thriller. While it is no masterpiece like "Theeran Adigaram Onru", it still doesnt bore you or have jarring bloody scenes. The plot sticks to the main story with no unnecessary characters or storylines.The experienced cop and rookie plays off very well where you can see the rookie keeps reacting to the situation while the experienced cop is totally immersed with almost zen like focus on solving it.If you have watched many thrillers then this movie does not hold anything special for you.Sarath Babu looks very weak and it must have been his last movie. He looks pathetic and I am surprised he was cast in such a critical role in that state. And not one you want to be your last one.The film hints at continuing the series and I would really want few more films with the detective duo solving cases along with the same actress as technical assistant.Overall a good watch with matured performances., I'll definitely recommend Por Thozhil to those who enjoy their share of investigative crime thrillers. It's been a while since we've come across a police procedural (in Tamil cinema) that focuses on the finer details, adding an uneasy dynamic between a rookie cop and an experienced (almost emotionless) veteran. Sarath Kumar and Ashok Selvan are both splendid in their respective roles (you'd know who's who by that description I gave). Director Vignesh Raja mentioned in interviews how he's fond of David Fincher's works, and the inspiration is evident. The framing style, the dark tones, the attention to detail - the debut filmmaker certainly shows promise.It somewhat follows the Ratchasan template of a serial killer with a flashback (and a decoy), yet the film works from both writing and technical standpoints. Jakes Bejoy's score adds to the tense mood, the performances are pretty much on point, and the twists keep coming. While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay . Script writing was on the point , right from the first shot they grab our attentions into the world of Por Thozhil and they never let down the intriguing factor till the end . Everything and every reference in the movie made sense , even small details never fails to pay off .

Highly recommended and kindly watch it on big screen ., A film comes and captures their audience, stick them to the screen make them to watch with out any remorse. Por Thozil is one such movie makes to stick to the screen. A crime thriller very neatly presented to the audience without any confusions. Actor Sarath Kumar proved that he can still play a leading man what a wonderful performance from him and Ashok selvan another brilliant actor whom not been used properly by Tamil film industry. Director Vignesh Raja gave us one of the best film for this year storytelling was a phenomenal. Actor Sarath babu gave a best performance in this. Expecting a another movie from the director., This movie Por Thozhil is one of the best crime thriller movie I have watched in my life.

What a script writing and they way it is directed ,everything is of very high class. Its like everything was placed in its proper place so well that it made the audience to fall in love with this movie.

While you won't be able to foresee the killer because his identity is unfurled layer by layer, and he shows up only in the final act (with a half-baked backstory), it's the proceedings until then that keep you on edge. There's a terrific stretch where the cop duo think they've "solved" the case only to realize that they've solved a totally different one. Let's get a sequel made soon enough, please?, The movie reminds you of Ratchasan at places and there is also a character named 'Ramkumar'. Veteran actors Sarath Kumar and Sarath Babu stole the show and the story has enough meat to show their prowess. The mystery element works well and all the main characters have a turbulent childhood and there is even a counter argument on serial killers in this movie.The technical team is just too good and thrills work at majority of the places. The reveals and misses are stunning and engaging. Though logically there are things don't work out, the writing is too good with enough depth for each characters. Do watch this movie!!, Por Thozhil - directed by Vignesh Raja featuring Sarath Kumar, Ashok Selvan and Nikhila Vimal in pivotal roles is a 147 minutes thriller drama that keeps you on the edge due to its smart, effective and intelligent writing.The story is set in 2010 and two women are murdered one after another and the police cannot find any clue. A senior police officer, Loganathan, played by Sarath Kumar and a recruit, Ashok Selvan's Prakash are appointed to investigate the case. The story explores how the senior police officer with his experience and practical knowledge and the rookie with his bookish knowledge crack the case.Director Vignesh Raja delivers a no-nonsense, straightforward plot line that continues to build suspense and anticipation till the end. The story explores childhood trauma inflicted by parents. Alfred Prakash and Vignesh Raja teamed up to make the screenplay different from the way it was told.Prakash is shown to be a scaredy cat right from the first shot, while Loganathan has an imposing presence and essays a stern police officer. Often Prakash's lack of experience and bookish knowledge annoys the senior police officer and they find themselves at loggerheads due to conflicting opinions. Nikhila Vimal has an important role but comparatively less screen time and still creates a lasting impact in all her scenes. The movie also starred the late actor Sarath Babu who added a different dynamic to the script with his mature performance. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not give him much screen time.The scenes were beautifully shot and the credit goes to cinematographer Kalaiselvan Sivaji. His contribution to the thriller is massive. He proves his exceptional talent in the railway gate scene right before the intermission. Throughout the movie, the makers have dropped casual hints and clues to let the audience guess who the killer is which makes the viewers glued to the skin and pay attention to every detail and makes it all the more interesting.Vignesh Raja on debut has come up with an intelligently scripted, layered psycho analysis of a film that will work for not only genre lovers but for the general crowd too. He is most definitely one of the finds of the year and may be the decade too., Director Vighnesh Raja defies generic investigative thriller tropes to deliver meticulously etched-out characters, harnessing the capabilities of his two leads to the fullest extent. Sarathkumar &amp; Ashok Selvan excel as a yin vs yang buddy cop pairing, delivering a compelling thriller that will have you hooked!This has to be the finest atmospheric thriller in Tamil cinema since the critically and commercially acclaimed "Ratsasan (2018)" with slow but assured pacing, intense character studies, finely calibrated performances and unexpected twists and turns. The pulsating music and sound design contribute to building the tension even more. A mandatory theatre watch!, I finally got to watch this after listening to and reading about all the hype and it was totally worth it, I left the film thinking "Man, I would love it if they make a sequel." The 8.5 and 97% scores are justified.I'm gonna keep this short and not reveal much. This was a thrilling police procedural without over the top masala &amp; heroism, a rarity by itself to begin with. You'll find this to be a very well written film above all. I'm glad they didn't have any high profile names who'd have over shadowed the script, but I wonder if the lack of a big name is limiting the reach this film should have had by now. It almost sounds like there's hardly been any marketing and whatever hype's been created, is purely based on word of mouth - which tells you something about the film. Don't just stop with the film, watch the director's interviews once you're done - masterclass on writing and cinematography. This will make you appreciate it more.The theater I was in had blaring music, wish that had been toned down. If I had to nitpick I can point to a few things and say this and that could have been slightly different, but never mind all that. Watch it, especially if you love a good thriller. You won't be disappointed., Por Thozhil appeared to be like a casual movie about cops investigating a series of murders until we got to the climax and things began to change 🤓There's no way you can sit quietly while watching this film, we were excited, disgusted, and actively involved in the investigation. Job well done.DELICIOUS-The first thing that struck us was the color grading. It was neat, clean, and just unleashed a thrilling atmosphere-Vignesh Raja brought many things new to the table, e.g. The profile of the murderer and the fact that the story carried important messages on the impact of abuse-It was innovative that Prakash didn't have the profile of the usual bulky confident cop; it allowed us to relate to his flaws. And giving away his mp3 player at the end was quite symbolic-The dialogues were very solid when it came to addressing the takeaway lessons. The film put an accent on how to earn respect, be brave, and deal with abuse--Acting was generally ok; our applause goes to the murderer for giving off creepiness and terror 👏🏻BLAND---The only negative would be the investigation method which was not discreet, e.g. Prakash was monitoring someone in a house next door while his room was well lit; there were several moments when Loganathan's car was closely following a suspect with light inside the car 😳, Fascinating investigation thrillerPor Thozhil is a usual investigation thriller story where two cops on their mission to catch a serial killer , but has it's own uniqueness and well written screenplay .
