['', I am a huge fan of Siddharth, and I have enjoyed most of his movies as they generally have a lot of substance. However, I was disappointed to see him in this particular film. I couldn't understand why such a talented actor like Siddharth would choose to act in a movie of this quality.I came across this movie on Netflix, and initially, I was intrigued because it was released in multiple languages and seemed to have a high budget. I had hoped for something along the lines of "Pushpa" or "KGF" with a perfect blend of entertainment and commercial elements. Unfortunately, this movie fell short of my expectations. It was filled with unnecessary and excessive elements that didn't contribute to the story.The only redeeming factor in the film was the comedy provided by Yogi Babu. However, everything else, including the plot, characters, and execution, was disappointing and felt like a waste of time., At the outset this film sets sail for artistic catastrophe with a plot as elusive as a mirage and characters as shallow as a sunbaked puddle. At the helm of this cinematic misadventure is the lead protagonist, whose performance is as soulless and mechanical as a malfunctioning automaton.His portrayal of the hero is as disconcerting as it is disappointing. Emotional scenes are met with a stone-cold visage, where attempts at tears feel as forced as a square peg in a round hole. His dialogue delivery, rather than drawing audiences into the narrative, feels jarringly unnatural and scripted. Moments that should inspire empathy or passion instead incite a sense of detached bewilderment.The film's haphazard visual style and disjointed sound design further mar the lead's performance, with the spotlight often thrown into dimly lit corners or drowned in an erratic score. However, these issues seem minuscule compared to the protagonist's staggering inability to breathe life into his role.In giving 'Takkar' a very generous 0.5 out of 5 stars, one must lament the squandered opportunity for compelling character portrayal. It serves as a stark reminder that a lead actor's commitment to authentic emotion and convincing delivery is paramount in ensuring a film's success. In 'Takkar's case, the lack thereof leads to a cinematic voyage best left uncharted., Average. Decent storyline. Screenplay has a million loopholes despite all of that Siddharth horrible perm is laughable dude it's time to give up the chocolate boy look and the silver stud that was even more hilarious. Overall worth a watch I mean I watched it on Netflix you would have to pay me to watch this in the cinemas. They blur out cleavage yet they have a one night stand go figure right. Overall Siddharth looked cute can watch for that other then that give it a miss unless u literally have nothing to watch on netflix. Boring and poor take on rom com with a twist of action. It was a cringe fest., Looks like no time given to write story of movie , just started making it and everything went on and on and the end .This is the same actor who acted in chashme badoor movie , such a magnificent acting that was , but seeing this my time completely wasted
I opened it to freshen up my mood but now writing this review.Actually more than acting, the script of movie was disappointing
I can say a third class script , could have made it better by adding their own creative ideas rather than copy pasting it .The time has gone when people used to enjoy such kind of stories, try something experimentalDisappointed!!, RATED 4/10

Source: NetflixStarted to watch this movie on the big screen, especially for the Nira song and Sidharth's performance. However, it turned out to be a huge disappointment in every aspect and ended in laptop watch. I couldn't buy into Sidharth's portrayal of a middle-class struggler; his mannerisms and appearance didn't seem convincing.Adding to my disappointment was the love track, which I found to be utterly unimpressive. The final reunion scene between the lovers was particularly poorly executed, making it one of the worst I've seen in any movie. Additionally, the hero's sidekick was an irritating character that often made me want to skip ahead in the film.The comedy track was outdated, and even the terror villain ended up joining the comedy brigade, which didn't sit well with me. The international human trafficking mafia could be brought down with just a single car hit, and the hero's fight to retrieve the heroine felt like the icing on the cake of implausibility.If there's any upside, it's that you might find some good time pass moments while watching this movie with friends., This movie is what's wrong with Tamil Cinema. I can't imagine this movie was pitched to a producer and then to the actors and the thought that they all thought this was a good idea and agreed to make this abomination just blows my mind. The music tells you whether the scene is a comedy but not the actors of the dialogues. Pathetic! This is an all time low for Siddharth. I saw his recent interview with Bharadwaj Rangan where he boasts like he had made a masterpiece. Also it looked like he stayed in character even for the interview.There is no writing. There is no arc. Everything is so random and boring and unfunny. I don't know why they cast Yogi Babu anymore. He has zero comic skills. Villain has the IQ of a potato., Sidharth Sir Your really awesome. Entrepreneurs and Smart working and Romantic people love this movie. I loved it. The story line is awesome. He showed the picture of love. Yogi sir ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ omg i keep on laughing. Best comedy ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. Audience please use good TV and Audio system. Reduce the bass and watch. The Villain in this movie is really terror and what if a boy do to become rich fast . That is what the whole movie tries to tell about. In life more than money love is important. That also will be proved in this film. Many chasing drifting omg. First half is like fast and Furious. The car burning it's wheel and the movie in fire., Feel good film. Siddharth acting is good. Divyansha is cute acting and beautiful face and then happy smile. Karthick direction is different for yester film kappal to now takker. And then yogi babu comedy is full of fun this film. Vigneshkanth is good support for this movie. Song is one is nira nira best. And other song is a drawback. Bgm are average. Choreography is better for visual in television. Divyansha is more hot for this movie. She is big future in our film carrier. Siddharth is huge acting. This film is over all huge success. I feel some good film. This is speech in after ten years. Because this story is related for every young boys., Others have done a good job summarizing how pathetic and lousy this movie is. I seldom watch Tamil movies but saw this on Netflix and thought to give it a try. It was such a waste of time.This movie normalizes hitting women. The female protagonist is hit twice - once by her onscreen fiancÃ© and next by the male protagonist. On both occasions the movie fails to address the issue. After being hit by the fiancÃ©, the actress picks up a glass of alcohol and moves away, while the rest of the people who saw her being slapped rush to the fiancÃ© to check whether he was alright. The abuser turns victim. It speaks of the society that women continue to live in and how hitting women is normalized.On another occasion, Siddharth, the actor hits the female protagonist. This time he does it to push her away from him - a show of tough love. As she gradually walks, the background musical score erupts with a choir going "aa aa" and the flute dramatizing the moment. It was just so shocking to me. Him slapping the woman was portrayed normal and a show of tough love. How do established actors like him agree to such scenes? Or does the society in general find such things normal? Disgusting!]['', I am a huge fan of Siddharth, and I have enjoyed most of his movies as they generally have a lot of substance.

I saw his recent interview with Bharadwaj Rangan where he boasts like he had made a masterpiece. Also it looked like he stayed in character even for the interview.There is no writing. There is no arc. Everything is so random and boring and unfunny. I don't know why they cast Yogi Babu anymore. He has zero comic skills. Villain has the IQ of a potato., Sidharth Sir Your really awesome. Entrepreneurs and Smart working and Romantic people love this movie. I loved it. The story line is awesome. He showed the picture of love. Yogi sir ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ omg i keep on laughing. Best comedy ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. Audience please use good TV and Audio system. Reduce the bass and watch. The Villain in this movie is really terror and what if a boy do to become rich fast . That is what the whole movie tries to tell about. In life more than money love is important. That also will be proved in this film. Many chasing drifting omg. First half is like fast and Furious. The car burning it's wheel and the movie in fire., Feel good film. Siddharth acting is good. Divyansha is cute acting and beautiful face and then happy smile. Karthick direction is different for yester film kappal to now takker. And then yogi babu comedy is full of fun this film. Vigneshkanth is good support for this movie. Song is one is nira nira best. And other song is a drawback. Bgm are average. Choreography is better for visual in television. Divyansha is more hot for this movie. She is big future in our film carrier. Siddharth is huge acting. This film is over all huge success. I feel some good film. This is speech in after ten years. Because this story is related for every young boys., Others have done a good job summarizing how pathetic and lousy this movie is. I seldom watch Tamil movies but saw this on Netflix and thought to give it a try. It was such a waste of time.This movie normalizes hitting women. The female protagonist is hit twice - once by her onscreen fiancÃ© and next by the male protagonist. On both occasions the movie fails to address the issue. After being hit by the fiancÃ©, the actress picks up a glass of alcohol and moves away, while the rest of the people who saw her being slapped rush to the fiancÃ© to check whether he was alright. The abuser turns victim. It speaks of the society that women continue to live in and how hitting women is normalized.On another occasion, Siddharth, the actor hits the female protagonist. This time he does it to push her away from him - a show of tough love. As she gradually walks, the background musical score erupts with a choir going "aa aa" and the flute dramatizing the moment. It was just so shocking to me. Him slapping the woman was portrayed normal and a show of tough love. How do established actors like him agree to such scenes? Or does the society in general find such things normal? Disgusting!]['', I am a huge fan of Siddharth, and I have enjoyed most of his movies as they generally have a lot of substance. However, I was disappointed to see him in this particular film. I couldn't understand why such a talented actor like Siddharth would choose to act in a movie of this quality.I came across this movie on Netflix, and initially, I was intrigued because it was released in multiple languages and seemed to have a high budget. I had hoped for something along the lines of "Pushpa" or "KGF" with a perfect blend of entertainment and commercial elements. Unfortunately, this movie fell short of my expectations. It was filled with unnecessary and excessive elements that didn't contribute to the story.The only redeeming factor in the film was the comedy provided by Yogi Babu. However, everything else, including the plot, characters, and execution, was disappointing and felt like a waste of time., At the outset this film sets sail for artistic catastrophe with a plot as elusive as a mirage and characters as shallow as a sunbaked puddle. At the helm of this cinematic misadventure is the lead protagonist, whose performance is as soulless and mechanical as a malfunctioning automaton.His portrayal of the hero is as disconcerting as it is disappointing. Emotional scenes are met with a stone-cold visage, where attempts at tears feel as forced as a square peg in a round hole. His dialogue delivery, rather than drawing audiences into the narrative, feels jarringly unnatural and scripted. Moments that should inspire empathy or passion instead incite a sense of detached bewilderment.The film's haphazard visual style and disjointed sound design further mar the lead's performance, with the spotlight often thrown into dimly lit corners or drowned in an erratic score. However, these issues seem minuscule compared to the protagonist's staggering inability to breathe life into his role.In giving 'Takkar' a very generous 0.5 out of 5 stars, one must lament the squandered opportunity for compelling character portrayal. It serves as a stark reminder that a lead actor's commitment to authentic emotion and convincing delivery is paramount in ensuring a film's success. In 'Takkar's case, the lack thereof leads to a cinematic voyage best left uncharted., Average. Decent storyline. Screenplay has a million loopholes despite all of that Siddharth horrible perm is laughable dude it's time to give up the chocolate boy look and the silver stud that was even more hilarious. Overall worth a watch I mean I watched it on Netflix you would have to pay me to watch this in the cinemas. They blur out cleavage yet they have a one night stand go figure right. Overall Siddharth looked cute can watch for that other then that give it a miss unless u literally have nothing to watch on netflix. Boring and poor take on rom com with a twist of action. It was a cringe fest., Looks like no time given to write story of movie , just started making it and everything went on and on and the end .This is the same actor who acted in chashme badoor movie , such a magnificent acting that was , but seeing this my time completely wasted
I opened it to freshen up my mood but now writing this review.Actually more than acting, the script of movie was disappointing
I can say a third class script , could have made it better by adding their own creative ideas rather than copy pasting it .The time has gone when people used to enjoy such kind of stories, try something experimentalDisappointed!!, RATED 4/10

Source: NetflixStarted to watch this movie on the big screen, especially for the Nira song and Sidharth's performance. However, it turned out to be a huge disappointment in every aspect and ended in laptop watch. I couldn't buy into Sidharth's portrayal of a middle-class struggler; his mannerisms and appearance didn't seem convincing.Adding to my disappointment was the love track, which I found to be utterly unimpressive. The final reunion scene between the lovers was particularly poorly executed, making it one of the worst I've seen in any movie. Additionally, the hero's sidekick was an irritating character that often made me want to skip ahead in the film.The comedy track was outdated, and even the terror villain ended up joining the comedy brigade, which didn't sit well with me. The international human trafficking mafia could be brought down with just a single car hit, and the hero's fight to retrieve the heroine felt like the icing on the cake of implausibility.If there's any upside, it's that you might find some good time pass moments while watching this movie with friends., This movie is what's wrong with Tamil Cinema.

Moments that should inspire empathy or passion instead incite a sense of detached bewilderment.The film's haphazard visual style and disjointed sound design further mar the lead's performance, with the spotlight often thrown into dimly lit corners or drowned in an erratic score. However, these issues seem minuscule compared to the protagonist's staggering inability to breathe life into his role.In giving 'Takkar' a very generous 0.5 out of 5 stars, one must lament the squandered opportunity for compelling character portrayal. It serves as a stark reminder that a lead actor's commitment to authentic emotion and convincing delivery is paramount in ensuring a film's success. In 'Takkar's case, the lack thereof leads to a cinematic voyage best left uncharted., Average. Decent storyline. Screenplay has a million loopholes despite all of that Siddharth horrible perm is laughable dude it's time to give up the chocolate boy look and the silver stud that was even more hilarious. Overall worth a watch I mean I watched it on Netflix you would have to pay me to watch this in the cinemas. They blur out cleavage yet they have a one night stand go figure right. Overall Siddharth looked cute can watch for that other then that give it a miss unless u literally have nothing to watch on netflix. Boring and poor take on rom com with a twist of action. It was a cringe fest., Looks like no time given to write story of movie , just started making it and everything went on and on and the end .This is the same actor who acted in chashme badoor movie , such a magnificent acting that was , but seeing this my time completely wasted
I opened it to freshen up my mood but now writing this review.Actually more than acting, the script of movie was disappointing
I can say a third class script , could have made it better by adding their own creative ideas rather than copy pasting it .The time has gone when people used to enjoy such kind of stories, try something experimentalDisappointed!!, RATED 4/10
Language: Tamil
Source: NetflixStarted to watch this movie on the big screen, especially for the Nira song and Sidharth's performance. However, it turned out to be a huge disappointment in every aspect and ended in laptop watch. I couldn't buy into Sidharth's portrayal of a middle-class struggler; his mannerisms and appearance didn't seem convincing.Adding to my disappointment was the love track, which I found to be utterly unimpressive. The final reunion scene between the lovers was particularly poorly executed, making it one of the worst I've seen in any movie. Additionally, the hero's sidekick was an irritating character that often made me want to skip ahead in the film.The comedy track was outdated, and even the terror villain ended up joining the comedy brigade, which didn't sit well with me. The international human trafficking mafia could be brought down with just a single car hit, and the hero's fight to retrieve the heroine felt like the icing on the cake of implausibility.If there's any upside, it's that you might find some good time pass moments while watching this movie with friends., This movie is what's wrong with Tamil Cinema. I can't imagine this movie was pitched to a producer and then to the actors and the thought that they all thought this was a good idea and agreed to make this abomination just blows my mind. The music tells you whether the scene is a comedy but not the actors of the dialogues. Pathetic! This is an all time low for Siddharth. I saw his recent interview with Bharadwaj Rangan where he boasts like he had made a masterpiece. Also it looked like he stayed in character even for the interview.There is no writing. There is no arc. Everything is so random and boring and unfunny. I don't know why they cast Yogi Babu anymore. He has zero comic skills. Villain has the IQ of a potato., Sidharth Sir Your really awesome. Entrepreneurs and Smart working and Romantic people love this movie. I loved it. The story line is awesome. He showed the picture of love. Yogi sir ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ omg i keep on laughing. Best comedy ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. Audience please use good TV and Audio system. Reduce the bass and watch. The Villain in this movie is really terror and what if a boy do to become rich fast . That is what the whole movie tries to tell about. In life more than money love is important. That also will be proved in this film. Many chasing drifting omg. First half is like fast and Furious. The car burning it's wheel and the movie in fire., Feel good film. Siddharth acting is good. Divyansha is cute acting and beautiful face and then happy smile. Karthick direction is different for yester film kappal to now takker. And then yogi babu comedy is full of fun this film. Vigneshkanth is good support for this movie. Song is one is nira nira best. And other song is a drawback. Bgm are average. Choreography is better for visual in television. Divyansha is more hot for this movie. She is big future in our film carrier. Siddharth is huge acting. This film is over all huge success. I feel some good film. This is speech in after ten years. Because this story is related for every young boys., Others have done a good job summarizing how pathetic and lousy this movie is. I seldom watch Tamil movies but saw this on Netflix and thought to give it a try. It was such a waste of time.This movie normalizes hitting women. The female protagonist is hit twice - once by her onscreen fiancÃ© and next by the male protagonist. On both occasions the movie fails to address the issue. After being hit by the fiancÃ©, the actress picks up a glass of alcohol and moves away, while the rest of the people who saw her being slapped rush to the fiancÃ© to check whether he was alright. The abuser turns victim. It speaks of the society that women continue to live in and how hitting women is normalized.On another occasion, Siddharth, the actor hits the female protagonist. This time he does it to push her away from him - a show of tough love. As she gradually walks, the background musical score erupts with a choir going "aa aa" and the flute dramatizing the moment. It was just so shocking to me. Him slapping the woman was portrayed normal and a show of tough love. How do established actors like him agree to such scenes? Or does the society in general find such things normal? Disgusting!]
