['', Well sadly, I will start with the bad, because the bad is mostly present here: there are very few redeeming aspects to it, as Pizza 3 borrows heavily elements from the Asian cinema, and by Asian cinema I mean Chinese, Korean, Japanese and so on.The movie is structured in 3 different stories, that overall work as an anthology that bind together at the very end, but the problem is we as viewers didn't require this much time with any of them. A movie this long feels boring and forced instead of offering some proper tension, jump scares or mystery.There is some mystery to it and a lot of wannabe jump scares that are so overused and so copy cat from the Asian cinema that it feels like I'm in the year 2000 again.As an Indian production it does have those long, close up shots, action scenes that are way too overly dramatic for no reason and a lot of moments where you need to shut your brain off because there is no reason to what's happening. But, no singing whatsoever so that's a plus.All in all, Pizza 3 is definitely not something to recommend as it is way too long, reuses plots from the past, fails in being scary, still hangs on to that Indian cinematic style that doesn't work here and is too silly at times.Cheers!, I made this account specifically to write this reviews. After seeing rating of 7.6, I thought this movie would be a good watch. Now, I feeling the ratings are fake.It feels like I wasted two hours sitting through this movie waiting for the plot to get more interesting. It is a cliche plot, half baked story, click bait type of title with no significance of the Mummy whatsoever. It seems the movie makers have save the plot for another sequel.Plus points: None.I want to mention any plus points in the movie but there are none. First half felt promising. The second half extremely disappointing. The more excited you feel in the first half, the more disappointing you will feel in the second half., The director and crew have put in a subpar work here comparing the orginal "Pizza". It's just another cliche templated horror crap which we have seen since forever, and the movie lost me before interval itself. The same struggling single mom n daughter story, who ends up in the hands of some goons
and eventually gets killed. The one thing I totally didn't like about the movie is that they brought up a mummy doll which doesn't have any significance to the story just to fool around for the film title.Not to mention the digital version of ouija board was totally funny and was definitely offsetting the horror mood. Rest all it's just boring jump scares and other stuff which are typical in horror genre since forever, nothing exciting at all. To sum it all up the hero of the film fights with the ghost side by side to kill the goons at the end!! What were they thinking, the guy was running around throughout the movie and since it's the climax let's make him fight and it'll be a ghost controlled fight , boom!!! That made me wanna kick the screen here. Wouldn't recommend this crap of a so called horror movie to anybody!!!, Screenplay was terrible with such cliche portrayal of mother and daughter scenes. The actor who played the mother was overdoing it terribly making the whole scenario less sympathetic. You don't need to overact to convince the audience. Ashok Selvan was the only saving Grace. Some scenes did manage to give the scares especially the haunting scenes in the kitchen but the story line was so predictable. Just a junk of scenes just stitched togather. The mummy relic had no significance to the story. The brother who played the cop looked and sounded so forced. Overall, waste of time and effort. Pls don't watch., Tamil cinema is miss using or wasting the Girl child abusing topic. One of the important but if solution or awarness to be made, then speak it or kindly dont miss use.Story, screen play are to the worst. Technically weak. No link for piza sequel or prequels.

The police man tries to insult hero and arrange alternate groom to his sister. In parellel some specious things happens in heros restaurant. Then the story takes away in an irritating manner till the film ends. Logic mistakes, artist dubbing problem, in few shot only heroine voice and shadow.

On the whole it's a same old wine presented in same old bottle with nothing new to offer for the audience...
Overall a usual horror flick that copies the Hollywood saga to gets its audience attract to the theatres which is misfired., The first 10 minutes, I really thought what a wonderful plot and so much potential the director has. The interview scene was well crafted .The Ouija app was a new and beautiful idea. But, how did the director use it? He completely wasted that idea. A Korean director would have capitalised with such wonderful idea in hand. You showed that the first ghost connected with the app, and then what happened, no information about it. It was never brought up anywhere later in the movie. There were many jump care screens which were brilliantly made. The kitchen scare scenes were really good... You were able to do that without much make up or CGI.It's obvious this is a low budget movie. You've to spend time on a tight screenplay if you want to make a masterpiece with a limited budget. And, he was there at one moment, but suddenly he drops the ball.If the ghosts are so powerful and can kill by itself, why did it involve the hero in the killing in first place? Was the motive of this even explained? And why was it not able to use the same powers to do the last kill? Just the director ran out of ideas is it?, I recently watched this movie, so many flaws.Firstly the mewa cake for the order of 35kg is require and later the next day it became 40kg.Second when the mother was searching for her daughter, there is the whole crew in the shadow.Third, director please don't make any movies.After that, why is the sound and the characters not sinking, for most of the actors their original voice has been changed, we all know the actor or actress real voice why did the director change or the sound engineer change the voices from original to dubbing.So many flaws in the movie, why did the ghost threat the restaurant owner friends? Sheesh,this movie is rotting to no screenplay. Sad to know ghost movies or horror movies are not up to the mark for Pizza 3. Pizza 3 is 1/10., Apart from Pizza effect or Thriller effect what every they tried I am very disappointed as soon as the voice overlay and lip sync was gone miles from the actors.Very boring same old "PEI" movie. Very good casting wasted. None of the characters developed properly and lots and lots of misconnections and cut scenes.Not sure what they try to achieve in this plot or story. Finally left audience nowhere. Pizza climax was so exiting and goosebumps, this 2 and 3 were no where near to it.Who's story is this The Mummy? Or Ashwin? Or The Girl? None of them is clear and no connection at all.My grandmother can tell better "PEI" story than these guys!, This movie is an absolute junk. More than a movie this is a compromise. Compromise on everything.Inside sources say the producer didn't give proper funding for the movie and never paid most of the actors who in return refused to dub their parts. But that's not it. At least the story and screenplay could've been better. This is such a template half baked horror cr@p. Every character is irritating and every twist is annoying.Pros:
NothingCons:

And lastly
There is no significance for the mummy doll and hence there is no justification for the title Pizza-the Mummy.Height of lethargic writing and filmmaking:
The ghost makes a delicious sweet in the restaurant and a guy gives an order for the sweet for 35kgs. The restaurant guys take the order and give the bill. You know how much the bill is ? 3500 Indian rupees. So 1kg is 100 Rupees? I seriously doubt the quality. It should be bad than this movie itself., Nice movie to watch. Excellent screenplay .Wonderful flim experience.. worth to watch in theatre. All actor are working fine for that role . Especially Hero character acted very smartly . Music all good .. perfect timings fits very well..
Bgm are really worth. Best line up with pizza platform. Waiting for pizza 4 . Pizza 3 is the movie based on ghost thriller. Characters are very unique . Plot wise very suspense and thrilling experience. Must watch and friends and family. Great work from producer to making this Film salute to thirukumaran enterprise

You know how much the bill is ? 3500 Indian rupees. So 1kg is 100 Rupees? I seriously doubt the quality. It should be bad than this movie itself., Nice movie to watch. Excellent screenplay .Wonderful flim experience.. worth to watch in theatre. All actor are working fine for that role . Especially Hero character acted very smartly .

Super sir. All techinication who worked for this movie are great work from them.. congrats entire team..]['', Well sadly, I will start with the bad, because the bad is mostly present here: there are very few redeeming aspects to it, as Pizza 3 borrows heavily elements from the Asian cinema, and by Asian cinema I mean Chinese, Korean, Japanese and so on.The movie is structured in 3 different stories, that overall work as an anthology that bind together at the very end, but the problem is we as viewers didn't require this much time with any of them. A movie this long feels boring and forced instead of offering some proper tension, jump scares or mystery.There is some mystery to it and a lot of wannabe jump scares that are so overused and so copy cat from the Asian cinema that it feels like I'm in the year 2000 again.As an Indian production it does have those long, close up shots, action scenes that are way too overly dramatic for no reason and a lot of moments where you need to shut your brain off because there is no reason to what's happening. But, no singing whatsoever so that's a plus.All in all, Pizza 3 is definitely not something to recommend as it is way too long, reuses plots from the past, fails in being scary, still hangs on to that Indian cinematic style that doesn't work here and is too silly at times.Cheers!, I made this account specifically to write this reviews. After seeing rating of 7.6, I thought this movie would be a good watch. Now, I feeling the ratings are fake.It feels like I wasted two hours sitting through this movie waiting for the plot to get more interesting. It is a cliche plot, half baked story, click bait type of title with no significance of the Mummy whatsoever. It seems the movie makers have save the plot for another sequel.Plus points: None.I want to mention any plus points in the movie but there are none. First half felt promising. The second half extremely disappointing. The more excited you feel in the first half, the more disappointing you will feel in the second half., The director and crew have put in a subpar work here comparing the orginal "Pizza". It's just another cliche templated horror crap which we have seen since forever, and the movie lost me before interval itself. The same struggling single mom n daughter story, who ends up in the hands of some goons
and eventually gets killed. The one thing I totally didn't like about the movie is that they brought up a mummy doll which doesn't have any significance to the story just to fool around for the film title.Not to mention the digital version of ouija board was totally funny and was definitely offsetting the horror mood. Rest all it's just boring jump scares and other stuff which are typical in horror genre since forever, nothing exciting at all. To sum it all up the hero of the film fights with the ghost side by side to kill the goons at the end!! What were they thinking, the guy was running around throughout the movie and since it's the climax let's make him fight and it'll be a ghost controlled fight , boom!!! That made me wanna kick the screen here. Wouldn't recommend this crap of a so called horror movie to anybody!!!, Screenplay was terrible with such cliche portrayal of mother and daughter scenes. The actor who played the mother was overdoing it terribly making the whole scenario less sympathetic. You don't need to overact to convince the audience. Ashok Selvan was the only saving Grace. Some scenes did manage to give the scares especially the haunting scenes in the kitchen but the story line was so predictable. Just a junk of scenes just stitched togather.

Overall a usual horror flick that copies the Hollywood saga to gets its audience attract to the theatres which is misfired., The first 10 minutes, I really thought what a wonderful plot and so much potential the director has. The interview scene was well crafted .The Ouija app was a new and beautiful idea. But, how did the director use it? He completely wasted that idea. A Korean director would have capitalised with such wonderful idea in hand. You showed that the first ghost connected with the app, and then what happened, no information about it. It was never brought up anywhere later in the movie. There were many jump care screens which were brilliantly made. The kitchen scare scenes were really good... You were able to do that without much make up or CGI.It's obvious this is a low budget movie. You've to spend time on a tight screenplay if you want to make a masterpiece with a limited budget. And, he was there at one moment, but suddenly he drops the ball.If the ghosts are so powerful and can kill by itself, why did it involve the hero in the killing in first place? Was the motive of this even explained? And why was it not able to use the same powers to do the last kill? Just the director ran out of ideas is it?, I recently watched this movie, so many flaws.Firstly the mewa cake for the order of 35kg is require and later the next day it became 40kg.Second when the mother was searching for her daughter, there is the whole crew in the shadow.Third, director please don't make any movies.After that, why is the sound and the characters not sinking, for most of the actors their original voice has been changed, we all know the actor or actress real voice why did the director change or the sound engineer change the voices from original to dubbing.So many flaws in the movie, why did the ghost threat the restaurant owner friends?

Overall a usual horror flick that copies the Hollywood saga to gets its audience attract to the theatres which is misfired., The first 10 minutes, I really thought what a wonderful plot and so much potential the director has. The interview scene was well crafted .The Ouija app was a new and beautiful idea. But, how did the director use it? He completely wasted that idea. A Korean director would have capitalised with such wonderful idea in hand. You showed that the first ghost connected with the app, and then what happened, no information about it. It was never brought up anywhere later in the movie. There were many jump care screens which were brilliantly made. The kitchen scare scenes were really good... You were able to do that without much make up or CGI.It's obvious this is a low budget movie. You've to spend time on a tight screenplay if you want to make a masterpiece with a limited budget. And, he was there at one moment, but suddenly he drops the ball.If the ghosts are so powerful and can kill by itself, why did it involve the hero in the killing in first place? Was the motive of this even explained? And why was it not able to use the same powers to do the last kill? Just the director ran out of ideas is it?, I recently watched this movie, so many flaws.Firstly the mewa cake for the order of 35kg is require and later the next day it became 40kg.Second when the mother was searching for her daughter, there is the whole crew in the shadow.Third, director please don't make any movies.After that, why is the sound and the characters not sinking, for most of the actors their original voice has been changed, we all know the actor or actress real voice why did the director change or the sound engineer change the voices from original to dubbing.So many flaws in the movie, why did the ghost threat the restaurant owner friends? Sheesh,this movie is rotting to no screenplay. Sad to know ghost movies or horror movies are not up to the mark for Pizza 3. Pizza 3 is 1/10., Apart from Pizza effect or Thriller effect what every they tried I am very disappointed as soon as the voice overlay and lip sync was gone miles from the actors.Very boring same old "PEI" movie. Very good casting wasted. None of the characters developed properly and lots and lots of misconnections and cut scenes.Not sure what they try to achieve in this plot or story. Finally left audience nowhere. Pizza climax was so exiting and goosebumps, this 2 and 3 were no where near to it.Who's story is this The Mummy? Or Ashwin? Or The Girl? None of them is clear and no connection at all.My grandmother can tell better "PEI" story than these guys!, This movie is an absolute junk. More than a movie this is a compromise. Compromise on everything.Inside sources say the producer didn't give proper funding for the movie and never paid most of the actors who in return refused to dub their parts. But that's not it.

You know how much the bill is ? 3500 Indian rupees. So 1kg is 100 Rupees? I seriously doubt the quality. It should be bad than this movie itself., Nice movie to watch. Excellent screenplay .Wonderful flim experience.. worth to watch in theatre. All actor are working fine for that role . Especially Hero character acted very smartly . Music all good .. perfect timings fits very well..
Bgm are really worth. Best line up with pizza platform. Waiting for pizza 4 . Pizza 3 is the movie based on ghost thriller. Characters are very unique .

Super sir. All techinication who worked for this movie are great work from them.. congrats entire team..]['', Well sadly, I will start with the bad, because the bad is mostly present here: there are very few redeeming aspects to it, as Pizza 3 borrows heavily elements from the Asian cinema, and by Asian cinema I mean Chinese, Korean, Japanese and so on.The movie is structured in 3 different stories, that overall work as an anthology that bind together at the very end, but the problem is we as viewers didn't require this much time with any of them. A movie this long feels boring and forced instead of offering some proper tension, jump scares or mystery.There is some mystery to it and a lot of wannabe jump scares that are so overused and so copy cat from the Asian cinema that it feels like I'm in the year 2000 again.As an Indian production it does have those long, close up shots, action scenes that are way too overly dramatic for no reason and a lot of moments where you need to shut your brain off because there is no reason to what's happening. But, no singing whatsoever so that's a plus.All in all, Pizza 3 is definitely not something to recommend as it is way too long, reuses plots from the past, fails in being scary, still hangs on to that Indian cinematic style that doesn't work here and is too silly at times.Cheers!, I made this account specifically to write this reviews. After seeing rating of 7.6, I thought this movie would be a good watch. Now, I feeling the ratings are fake.It feels like I wasted two hours sitting through this movie waiting for the plot to get more interesting. It is a cliche plot, half baked story, click bait type of title with no significance of the Mummy whatsoever. It seems the movie makers have save the plot for another sequel.Plus points: None.I want to mention any plus points in the movie but there are none. First half felt promising. The second half extremely disappointing. The more excited you feel in the first half, the more disappointing you will feel in the second half., The director and crew have put in a subpar work here comparing the orginal "Pizza". It's just another cliche templated horror crap which we have seen since forever, and the movie lost me before interval itself. The same struggling single mom n daughter story, who ends up in the hands of some goons
and eventually gets killed. The one thing I totally didn't like about the movie is that they brought up a mummy doll which doesn't have any significance to the story just to fool around for the film title.Not to mention the digital version of ouija board was totally funny and was definitely offsetting the horror mood. Rest all it's just boring jump scares and other stuff which are typical in horror genre since forever, nothing exciting at all. To sum it all up the hero of the film fights with the ghost side by side to kill the goons at the end!! What were they thinking, the guy was running around throughout the movie and since it's the climax let's make him fight and it'll be a ghost controlled fight , boom!!! That made me wanna kick the screen here. Wouldn't recommend this crap of a so called horror movie to anybody!!!, Screenplay was terrible with such cliche portrayal of mother and daughter scenes. The actor who played the mother was overdoing it terribly making the whole scenario less sympathetic. You don't need to overact to convince the audience. Ashok Selvan was the only saving Grace.

But, no singing whatsoever so that's a plus.All in all, Pizza 3 is definitely not something to recommend as it is way too long, reuses plots from the past, fails in being scary, still hangs on to that Indian cinematic style that doesn't work here and is too silly at times.Cheers!, I made this account specifically to write this reviews. After seeing rating of 7.6, I thought this movie would be a good watch. Now, I feeling the ratings are fake.It feels like I wasted two hours sitting through this movie waiting for the plot to get more interesting. It is a cliche plot, half baked story, click bait type of title with no significance of the Mummy whatsoever. It seems the movie makers have save the plot for another sequel.Plus points: None.I want to mention any plus points in the movie but there are none. First half felt promising. The second half extremely disappointing. The more excited you feel in the first half, the more disappointing you will feel in the second half., The director and crew have put in a subpar work here comparing the orginal "Pizza". It's just another cliche templated horror crap which we have seen since forever, and the movie lost me before interval itself. The same struggling single mom n daughter story, who ends up in the hands of some goons
and eventually gets killed. The one thing I totally didn't like about the movie is that they brought up a mummy doll which doesn't have any significance to the story just to fool around for the film title.Not to mention the digital version of ouija board was totally funny and was definitely offsetting the horror mood. Rest all it's just boring jump scares and other stuff which are typical in horror genre since forever, nothing exciting at all. To sum it all up the hero of the film fights with the ghost side by side to kill the goons at the end!! What were they thinking, the guy was running around throughout the movie and since it's the climax let's make him fight and it'll be a ghost controlled fight , boom!!! That made me wanna kick the screen here. Wouldn't recommend this crap of a so called horror movie to anybody!!!, Screenplay was terrible with such cliche portrayal of mother and daughter scenes. The actor who played the mother was overdoing it terribly making the whole scenario less sympathetic. You don't need to overact to convince the audience. Ashok Selvan was the only saving Grace. Some scenes did manage to give the scares especially the haunting scenes in the kitchen but the story line was so predictable. Just a junk of scenes just stitched togather. The mummy relic had no significance to the story. The brother who played the cop looked and sounded so forced. Overall, waste of time and effort. Pls don't watch., Tamil cinema is miss using or wasting the Girl child abusing topic. One of the important but if solution or awarness to be made, then speak it or kindly dont miss use.Story, screen play are to the worst. Technically weak. No link for piza sequel or prequels. By the way no single relation to the film name and story "The Mummy". Save the devils from this team.Ashwin hero running an coffee shop in love with a girl who is sister of a police man. The police man tries to insult hero and arrange alternate groom to his sister. In parellel some specious things happens in heros restaurant. Then the story takes away in an irritating manner till the film ends. Logic mistakes, artist dubbing problem, in few shot only heroine voice and shadow. Why did one Egyptian mummy toy was used and why mummy name was used is no clue. If someone could decode please comment.Hardly no points to appreciate or atleast to say good. In difficult found camera work was ok., The main strength of the first flick of "PIZZA" is it's tricky screenplay which swindled the minds of viewers and a benchmark for the rise of new age directors who created history of not practiced the art of asst directors...
The only thing that was carry forwarded is it's technical brilliance in terms of lighting and bgm...otherwise it's been 5agged as a horror flick for the last two outings...
On the whole it's a same old wine presented in same old bottle with nothing new to offer for the audience...
Overall a usual horror flick that copies the Hollywood saga to gets its audience attract to the theatres which is misfired., The first 10 minutes, I really thought what a wonderful plot and so much potential the director has. The interview scene was well crafted .The Ouija app was a new and beautiful idea. But, how did the director use it? He completely wasted that idea. A Korean director would have capitalised with such wonderful idea in hand. You showed that the first ghost connected with the app, and then what happened, no information about it. It was never brought up anywhere later in the movie. There were many jump care screens which were brilliantly made. The kitchen scare scenes were really good... You were able to do that without much make up or CGI.It's obvious this is a low budget movie. You've to spend time on a tight screenplay if you want to make a masterpiece with a limited budget. And, he was there at one moment, but suddenly he drops the ball.If the ghosts are so powerful and can kill by itself, why did it involve the hero in the killing in first place? Was the motive of this even explained? And why was it not able to use the same powers to do the last kill? Just the director ran out of ideas is it?, I recently watched this movie, so many flaws.Firstly the mewa cake for the order of 35kg is require and later the next day it became 40kg.Second when the mother was searching for her daughter, there is the whole crew in the shadow.Third, director please don't make any movies.After that, why is the sound and the characters not sinking, for most of the actors their original voice has been changed, we all know the actor or actress real voice why did the director change or the sound engineer change the voices from original to dubbing.So many flaws in the movie, why did the ghost threat the restaurant owner friends? Sheesh,this movie is rotting to no screenplay. Sad to know ghost movies or horror movies are not up to the mark for Pizza 3. Pizza 3 is 1/10., Apart from Pizza effect or Thriller effect what every they tried I am very disappointed as soon as the voice overlay and lip sync was gone miles from the actors.Very boring same old "PEI" movie. Very good casting wasted. None of the characters developed properly and lots and lots of misconnections and cut scenes.Not sure what they try to achieve in this plot or story. Finally left audience nowhere. Pizza climax was so exiting and goosebumps, this 2 and 3 were no where near to it.Who's story is this The Mummy? Or Ashwin? Or The Girl? None of them is clear and no connection at all.My grandmother can tell better "PEI" story than these guys!, This movie is an absolute junk. More than a movie this is a compromise. Compromise on everything.Inside sources say the producer didn't give proper funding for the movie and never paid most of the actors who in return refused to dub their parts. But that's not it. At least the story and screenplay could've been better. This is such a template half baked horror cr@p. Every character is irritating and every twist is annoying.Pros:
NothingCons:
Direction
Story
Screenplay
Music
Production value
Casting
Performances
And lastly
There is no significance for the mummy doll and hence there is no justification for the title Pizza-the Mummy.Height of lethargic writing and filmmaking:
The ghost makes a delicious sweet in the restaurant and a guy gives an order for the sweet for 35kgs. The restaurant guys take the order and give the bill. You know how much the bill is ? 3500 Indian rupees. So 1kg is 100 Rupees? I seriously doubt the quality. It should be bad than this movie itself., Nice movie to watch. Excellent screenplay .Wonderful flim experience.. worth to watch in theatre. All actor are working fine for that role . Especially Hero character acted very smartly . Music all good .. perfect timings fits very well..
Bgm are really worth. Best line up with pizza platform. Waiting for pizza 4 . Pizza 3 is the movie based on ghost thriller. Characters are very unique . Plot wise very suspense and thrilling experience. Must watch and friends and family. Great work from producer to making this Film salute to thirukumaran enterprise
