Comedy is top notch but not upto vadivelus previous movie standards ..Vadivelu does show some on screen rust so to speak but as the movie progresses he comes back to his original form ..Redin kingsley was a peasant surprise played his part very well tried not to overshadow vadivelu and played good supporting role .. some hillarious moments in the movie ..Hope vadivelu also starts doing comedy track in movies as he used to before .. with his typical crew and style .. tamil cinema misses him a lot ..all in all an excellent movie to watch in OTT .time well spent.]['', This one is ought to be Vadivelu's comeback (the greatest comedian produced by Tamil Cinema).There couldn't have been this kinda worst comeback ever.The movie starts off with a very good introduction scene with nice gameplay and it gives an expectation that we're about to witness something nice but it starts wearing off from that very moment and there's literally 0 content after that, the plot wears off.Vadivelu's comeback should ideally make us laugh to the core but it is made in such a way that we're laughing at the movie itself.There's not even a single scene where the laughter erupts, it's a sluggish thing all over, and passing these 2+ hours was a nightmarethe first film of this year turned out to be the worst movie ever watched.Overall, better avoid it and not fall into the trap of the Vadivelu brand., The comeback movie of vadivelu does not disappoint ..excellent acting by the three lead characters and the.
