['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

RECOMMENDEDVery simple story and it is presented in full length feature film with solid entertainment and sentiments. Especially the heroine character, that is so lovely and so mature. Manikandan eased out the character and so good on this role.There is no lagging moment and the comic moments are spread throughout the movie.

Good night is a pure hit. The story and screenplay is so good. Usual simple and elegant and flawless , not a place bored. I could connect my life with many of the situations , especially my family and office life. Manikandan truely he is a monster in acting, nailed with his performances, elegant in his acting skills effortless. Ramesh thilak etc and all others have performed their part, every character has a role to play which is quite good to see. Every character has some reason to stay. I would like to give a special mention meetha raghunath oh boy her acting and innocense throughout the film is soo cute and pretty. Every boys dream to have a wife like Anu loved it. Overall an amazing heartfelt movie must watch available in hotstar., Thanks to writer, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran for give a feel good movie. All actors portraited their characters very well. Special applause to Manikandan, Meetha Raghunath, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca.When the man with Snoring tries different methods to solve that, my inner self repeatedly saying that it is an issue for the girl for few days only, she will get adapt to the sound in few days. There is no one to explain that, to the couples.The movie never lags anywhere, a simple story on a daily file issue given in straight forward screen play. Music, Cinematography, Art work all are very beautiful. I gave of 10 for the perfection and to encourage such a content.Saw it with Family we laughed loud and Loved it!Kudos., One of the best Entertainment movie. All actor are nailed The our performance. Screenplay was Really Impressed. What a fantabulous story line. Actor Manikandan Proves another Level of Our skill. Heroine Not a first movie acting, She live In character. All scenes are really touched. And One small dog is to an acting well, Roll nice. Mama character the man One of the most talented person. Total this movie üçø best Entertaining. Climax more energetic performance of all. Debut Director we'll make that the movie. All characters are acting Well as our parts. Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023.

Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie .

Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it.

Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude.

How I forgot we laughed lots such simple and good comedy not lost in dubbing to Hindi.such good movies please make required Dubbaka as well in Hindi if not Marathi. Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

RECOMMENDEDVery simple story and it is presented in full length feature film with solid entertainment and sentiments. Especially the heroine character, that is so lovely and so mature. Manikandan eased out the character and so good on this role.There is no lagging moment and the comic moments are spread throughout the movie.

Good night is a pure hit. The story and screenplay is so good. Usual simple and elegant and flawless , not a place bored. I could connect my life with many of the situations , especially my family and office life. Manikandan truely he is a monster in acting, nailed with his performances, elegant in his acting skills effortless. Ramesh thilak etc and all others have performed their part, every character has a role to play which is quite good to see. Every character has some reason to stay. I would like to give a special mention meetha raghunath oh boy her acting and innocense throughout the film is soo cute and pretty. Every boys dream to have a wife like Anu loved it. Overall an amazing heartfelt movie must watch available in hotstar., Thanks to writer, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran for give a feel good movie. All actors portraited their characters very well. Special applause to Manikandan, Meetha Raghunath, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca.When the man with Snoring tries different methods to solve that, my inner self repeatedly saying that it is an issue for the girl for few days only, she will get adapt to the sound in few days. There is no one to explain that, to the couples.The movie never lags anywhere, a simple story on a daily file issue given in straight forward screen play. Music, Cinematography, Art work all are very beautiful. I gave of 10 for the perfection and to encourage such a content.Saw it with Family we laughed loud and Loved it!Kudos., One of the best Entertainment movie. All actor are nailed The our performance. Screenplay was Really Impressed. What a fantabulous story line. Actor Manikandan Proves another Level of Our skill. Heroine Not a first movie acting, She live In character. All scenes are really touched. And One small dog is to an acting well, Roll nice. Mama character the man One of the most talented person. Total this movie üçø best Entertaining. Climax more energetic performance of all. Debut Director we'll make that the movie. All characters are acting Well as our parts. Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role.

Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category

And stand on top of it üí™üí™Wonder full movieI completely enjoyed itThanks for making like this movie., Today we watched good night movie on Disney Hotstar, it was full family's entertainer movie , after so long we watch such feel good movie, we did watched as Hindi dubbed , really good movie all emotions full filled, family awesome, Jiju sister mom uncle auntie motors Mohan did great acting, he is one of good actors, like his acting's in kaala, jay bhim etc Anu also played good actor, even we loved litter doggy, thanks you for entertaining. How I forgot we laughed lots such simple and good comedy not lost in dubbing to Hindi.such good movies please make required Dubbaka as well in Hindi if not Marathi. Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

RECOMMENDEDVery simple story and it is presented in full length feature film with solid entertainment and sentiments. Especially the heroine character, that is so lovely and so mature. Manikandan eased out the character and so good on this role.There is no lagging moment and the comic moments are spread throughout the movie.

Good night is a pure hit. The story and screenplay is so good. Usual simple and elegant and flawless , not a place bored. I could connect my life with many of the situations , especially my family and office life. Manikandan truely he is a monster in acting, nailed with his performances, elegant in his acting skills effortless. Ramesh thilak etc and all others have performed their part, every character has a role to play which is quite good to see. Every character has some reason to stay. I would like to give a special mention meetha raghunath oh boy her acting and innocense throughout the film is soo cute and pretty. Every boys dream to have a wife like Anu loved it. Overall an amazing heartfelt movie must watch available in hotstar., Thanks to writer, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran for give a feel good movie. All actors portraited their characters very well. Special applause to Manikandan, Meetha Raghunath, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca.When the man with Snoring tries different methods to solve that, my inner self repeatedly saying that it is an issue for the girl for few days only, she will get adapt to the sound in few days. There is no one to explain that, to the couples.The movie never lags anywhere, a simple story on a daily file issue given in straight forward screen play. Music, Cinematography, Art work all are very beautiful. I gave of 10 for the perfection and to encourage such a content.Saw it with Family we laughed loud and Loved it!Kudos., One of the best Entertainment movie. All actor are nailed The our performance. Screenplay was Really Impressed. What a fantabulous story line. Actor Manikandan Proves another Level of Our skill. Heroine Not a first movie acting, She live In character. All scenes are really touched. And One small dog is to an acting well, Roll nice. Mama character the man One of the most talented person. Total this movie üçø best Entertaining. Climax more energetic performance of all. Debut Director we'll make that the movie. All characters are acting Well as our parts. Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023.

Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category

And stand on top of it üí™üí™Wonder full movieI completely enjoyed itThanks for making like this movie., Today we watched good night movie on Disney Hotstar, it was full family's entertainer movie , after so long we watch such feel good movie, we did watched as Hindi dubbed , really good movie all emotions full filled, family awesome, Jiju sister mom uncle auntie motors Mohan did great acting, he is one of good actors, like his acting's in kaala, jay bhim etc Anu also played good actor, even we loved litter doggy, thanks you for entertaining. How I forgot we laughed lots such simple and good comedy not lost in dubbing to Hindi.such good movies please make required Dubbaka as well in Hindi if not Marathi. Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

Manikandan eased out the character and so good on this role.There is no lagging moment and the comic moments are spread throughout the movie.

I could connect my life with many of the situations , especially my family and office life. Manikandan truely he is a monster in acting, nailed with his performances, elegant in his acting skills effortless. Ramesh thilak etc and all others have performed their part, every character has a role to play which is quite good to see. Every character has some reason to stay. I would like to give a special mention meetha raghunath oh boy her acting and innocense throughout the film is soo cute and pretty. Every boys dream to have a wife like Anu loved it. Overall an amazing heartfelt movie must watch available in hotstar., Thanks to writer, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran for give a feel good movie. All actors portraited their characters very well. Special applause to Manikandan, Meetha Raghunath, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca.When the man with Snoring tries different methods to solve that, my inner self repeatedly saying that it is an issue for the girl for few days only, she will get adapt to the sound in few days. There is no one to explain that, to the couples.The movie never lags anywhere, a simple story on a daily file issue given in straight forward screen play. Music, Cinematography, Art work all are very beautiful. I gave of 10 for the perfection and to encourage such a content.Saw it with Family we laughed loud and Loved it!Kudos., One of the best Entertainment movie. All actor are nailed The our performance.

Climax more energetic performance of all. Debut Director we'll make that the movie. All characters are acting Well as our parts. Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family .

Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great .

Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes.

And stand on top of it üí™üí™Wonder full movieI completely enjoyed itThanks for making like this movie., Today we watched good night movie on Disney Hotstar, it was full family's entertainer movie , after so long we watch such feel good movie, we did watched as Hindi dubbed , really good movie all emotions full filled, family awesome, Jiju sister mom uncle auntie motors Mohan did great acting, he is one of good actors, like his acting's in kaala, jay bhim etc Anu also played good actor, even we loved litter doggy, thanks you for entertaining. How I forgot we laughed lots such simple and good comedy not lost in dubbing to Hindi.such good movies please make required Dubbaka as well in Hindi if not Marathi. Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

RECOMMENDEDVery simple story and it is presented in full length feature film with solid entertainment and sentiments. Especially the heroine character, that is so lovely and so mature. Manikandan eased out the character and so good on this role.There is no lagging moment and the comic moments are spread throughout the movie. Even some sentiment scenes are sparkled with one liner.The climax portion of last 15 minutes are bit dragged and seen multiple times in Tamil movies.This one is definitely the Must watch and best choice to watch with family., This is going to be my one of the best heart felt family drama. Good night is a pure hit. The story and screenplay is so good. Usual simple and elegant and flawless , not a place bored. I could connect my life with many of the situations , especially my family and office life. Manikandan truely he is a monster in acting, nailed with his performances, elegant in his acting skills effortless. Ramesh thilak etc and all others have performed their part, every character has a role to play which is quite good to see. Every character has some reason to stay. I would like to give a special mention meetha raghunath oh boy her acting and innocense throughout the film is soo cute and pretty. Every boys dream to have a wife like Anu loved it. Overall an amazing heartfelt movie must watch available in hotstar., Thanks to writer, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran for give a feel good movie. All actors portraited their characters very well. Special applause to Manikandan, Meetha Raghunath, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca.When the man with Snoring tries different methods to solve that, my inner self repeatedly saying that it is an issue for the girl for few days only, she will get adapt to the sound in few days. There is no one to explain that, to the couples.The movie never lags anywhere, a simple story on a daily file issue given in straight forward screen play. Music, Cinematography, Art work all are very beautiful. I gave of 10 for the perfection and to encourage such a content.Saw it with Family we laughed loud and Loved it!Kudos., One of the best Entertainment movie. All actor are nailed The our performance. Screenplay was Really Impressed. What a fantabulous story line. Actor Manikandan Proves another Level of Our skill. Heroine Not a first movie acting, She live In character. All scenes are really touched. And One small dog is to an acting well, Roll nice. Mama character the man One of the most talented person. Total this movie üçø best Entertaining. Climax more energetic performance of all. Debut Director we'll make that the movie. All characters are acting Well as our parts. Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role. As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great .

How I forgot we laughed lots such simple and good comedy not lost in dubbing to Hindi.such good movies please make required Dubbaka as well in Hindi if not Marathi. Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life .

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

RECOMMENDEDVery simple story and it is presented in full length feature film with solid entertainment and sentiments. Especially the heroine character, that is so lovely and so mature. Manikandan eased out the character and so good on this role.There is no lagging moment and the comic moments are spread throughout the movie. Even some sentiment scenes are sparkled with one liner.The climax portion of last 15 minutes are bit dragged and seen multiple times in Tamil movies.This one is definitely the Must watch and best choice to watch with family., This is going to be my one of the best heart felt family drama. Good night is a pure hit. The story and screenplay is so good. Usual simple and elegant and flawless , not a place bored. I could connect my life with many of the situations , especially my family and office life. Manikandan truely he is a monster in acting, nailed with his performances, elegant in his acting skills effortless. Ramesh thilak etc and all others have performed their part, every character has a role to play which is quite good to see. Every character has some reason to stay. I would like to give a special mention meetha raghunath oh boy her acting and innocense throughout the film is soo cute and pretty. Every boys dream to have a wife like Anu loved it. Overall an amazing heartfelt movie must watch available in hotstar., Thanks to writer, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran for give a feel good movie. All actors portraited their characters very well. Special applause to Manikandan, Meetha Raghunath, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca.When the man with Snoring tries different methods to solve that, my inner self repeatedly saying that it is an issue for the girl for few days only, she will get adapt to the sound in few days. There is no one to explain that, to the couples.The movie never lags anywhere, a simple story on a daily file issue given in straight forward screen play. Music, Cinematography, Art work all are very beautiful. I gave of 10 for the perfection and to encourage such a content.Saw it with Family we laughed loud and Loved it!Kudos., One of the best Entertainment movie. All actor are nailed The our performance. Screenplay was Really Impressed. What a fantabulous story line. Actor Manikandan Proves another Level of Our skill. Heroine Not a first movie acting, She live In character. All scenes are really touched. And One small dog is to an acting well, Roll nice. Mama character the man One of the most talented person. Total this movie üçø best Entertaining. Climax more energetic performance of all. Debut Director we'll make that the movie. All characters are acting Well as our parts. Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role. As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life .

Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life .

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

RECOMMENDEDVery simple story and it is presented in full length feature film with solid entertainment and sentiments. Especially the heroine character, that is so lovely and so mature. Manikandan eased out the character and so good on this role.There is no lagging moment and the comic moments are spread throughout the movie. Even some sentiment scenes are sparkled with one liner.The climax portion of last 15 minutes are bit dragged and seen multiple times in Tamil movies.This one is definitely the Must watch and best choice to watch with family., This is going to be my one of the best heart felt family drama. Good night is a pure hit. The story and screenplay is so good. Usual simple and elegant and flawless , not a place bored. I could connect my life with many of the situations , especially my family and office life. Manikandan truely he is a monster in acting, nailed with his performances, elegant in his acting skills effortless. Ramesh thilak etc and all others have performed their part, every character has a role to play which is quite good to see. Every character has some reason to stay. I would like to give a special mention meetha raghunath oh boy her acting and innocense throughout the film is soo cute and pretty. Every boys dream to have a wife like Anu loved it. Overall an amazing heartfelt movie must watch available in hotstar., Thanks to writer, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran for give a feel good movie. All actors portraited their characters very well. Special applause to Manikandan, Meetha Raghunath, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca.When the man with Snoring tries different methods to solve that, my inner self repeatedly saying that it is an issue for the girl for few days only, she will get adapt to the sound in few days. There is no one to explain that, to the couples.The movie never lags anywhere, a simple story on a daily file issue given in straight forward screen play. Music, Cinematography, Art work all are very beautiful. I gave of 10 for the perfection and to encourage such a content.Saw it with Family we laughed loud and Loved it!Kudos., One of the best Entertainment movie. All actor are nailed The our performance. Screenplay was Really Impressed. What a fantabulous story line. Actor Manikandan Proves another Level of Our skill. Heroine Not a first movie acting, She live In character. All scenes are really touched. And One small dog is to an acting well, Roll nice. Mama character the man One of the most talented person. Total this movie üçø best Entertaining. Climax more energetic performance of all. Debut Director we'll make that the movie. All characters are acting Well as our parts. Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role. As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn.

And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows.

Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life .

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director.

It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning.

I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category

Thank you.]['', Simple and sweetGood Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life .

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role. As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role. As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role. As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category

Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Except being a tiny bit stretched in second half, this movie is a delight to watch. The screenplay, cinematography, art, direction, characters are fantastically done. Manikandan is such a natural actor and the movie is shot so beautifully that one can't help comparing it with the fine movies in malayalam cinema that portrays the plight of a common man in a manner that you feel you are there in it, next to them, and see it happening. Very immersive story with a great acting and portrayal of characters by all the actors. First half is a delight to watch but second half felt lengthy and some segments felt unnecessarily stretched. Songs are less but beautiful and are in sync with the story. One time watch in theater definitely. Sometimes we all need a break from the masala and commercial movies that show unrealistic things. This is good cinema technically and otherwise., Finally a romantic story that made sense! Good Night was a down-to-earth and relatable film that used a common topic like snoring and turned it into a captivating entertainment-Usually love stories begin the romance in one of 2 ways: either the man falls in love at first sight or he goes about arguing with a girl then he slowly falls in love.Good Night took on a natural approach to Mohan's and Anu's relationship that it was very believable. And these two characters weren't the typical lovers in terms of appearance and behaviors-Watching the movie felt really homey and comfortable. The handheld camera movement in the opening scene was a great intro to Mohan's house and family. And the soundtrack had a cozy laid-back vibe-A common snoring problem was used to unveil some underlying issues that needed to be addressed and also revealed people's values. Brilliant!Kudos to Raichal Rabecca for displaying a courageous and caring spirit, and perseverance despite all the hardshipsK. Manikandan's and Meetha's chemistry worked really well, like a real couple, everytime they hugged each other, we sensed itüòç-The puppy was a gentle touch to the film, kinda like a reflection of Anu as both were "abandoned" and alone. But when love and company came into their lives, they were able to thrive and be happy., Watching this was great fun! It's not often that one can use a down-to-earth plot device to craft a funny and humorous screenplay like this. The simple nature of the plot and the way it manages to jump over hurdles make it a greatly engaging story for people of most backgrounds and classes.The acting is another plus, especially that of Meetha Raghunath in her role as Anu. She gives the film a whole other dimension with her genuine character and humble nature. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak were also absolutely incredible in their roles and were received overwhelmingly positively.Overall, Good Night is sure to leave you with a smile. It is an immaculately written, simple, and innocent flick that engages people with a minimalist style., After watching this movie I felt very happy, this is not any top hero movie nor has any high end CG or it is not directed by a top Elite directors
It has a simple story with a non star studded best actors like Manikandan, Ramesh Thilak, Raichal Rabecca Philip and my favourite Meetha Raghunath.The way Meetha Raghunath acted it felt like a typical shy person with all the negetive burdon place on her by the people arround her.And same goes to Manikandan the way he showed his lack of self confidence due to his snoring problem and the way he shows his love to his wife through his tears in the hospital scene is really very good.And on top of all that Ramesh Thilak and Raichal Rabecca Philip give a different dimension of a husband and wife relationship which I have not yet come across in any other movie
And to conclude this is an actual family movie which may even catch the attention of children but the movie must be watched by all the husbands and wives., Good Night has a solidly funny first half that establishes its core theme and conflicts, but the way it tries to solve them in the (somewhat stretched) second feels comparatively less entertaining. The proceedings remain realistically grounded throughout, however, a more serious tone replaces the humour in the latter half. The performances are uniformly splendid, be it in the execution of situational humour or sentimental scenes. Manikandan and Ramesh Thilak both excel in their respective roles, and their brotherly chemistry is fantastic to watch. The ladies of the house deliver a great job as well, and the writing gives them sufficient texturing and elevatory moments. Does the film offer a "solution" to its "problem"? Nope. It just tells you how to live with them., A feel-good movie with a very small storyline.There are 2 scenes (spoilers here): Abortion, Snoring.The core plot of the film is just based on these 2 scenes and nothing else and I couldn't help but think only of Selvaraghavan films, both these scenes/concepts are shown as just one of the scenes in his 3 hour long movies. I'm trying to highlight this because I really want people to understand the MAGNIFICENCE of Selvaraghavan's writings and we've missed celebrating the genius and pushing him into the acting field denoting how miserable we are as the audience.Overall, it's a well-made emotional drama with a good mix of comedy/humor, love/romance, sentiments/emotions, and life in general but I see this entire film as a spin-off of Selvaraghavan's film scenes., "Good Night" is an awesome rom-com that hooks you with its fresh storyline, superb acting, and hilarious comedy. This movie is a perfect blend of heartwarming drama and laugh-out-loud moments that keep you engaged throughout. It's a well-crafted flick that just feels good to watch because it's so relatable. Although there are a few minor drawbacks in the writing, like the writer playing it safe to avoid being overly dramatic and filmy, they don't really bother you while watching. Overall, "Good Night" is a delightful and entertaining film that will leave you with a big smile on your face. A Simple and Refreshing Feel-Good Drama., Watching this was great fun!

Best Director List includes this movie director name and last but not least producer The movie of Statue., These type soft romantic family drama movies should get promoted and encouraged. A simple story line with very good acting and direction. A feel good movie. Lead actor Manikandan is a multitalented person.. Lead actress fitted very good for the character will definitely take a place in our hearts. The family setup, conversations, happenings... we won't feel like watching a movie, a neighbourhood happening or in our family. But, Yes.. you may find flaws here and there.. but who cares.. in an industry that produces movies like hero making a villain fly... showing rowdies as heroes.. this movie stands out make you feel good with near real life story., Liked the story, moreover the screenplay... The story was well told without boring us and without getting repetitive...
Acting was excellent - Manikandan, Meetha, Ramesh Tilak, Rachael and especially the dog!!!Loved the production design.In one of the songs Chennai was depicted nicely!!! Excellent photography - especially the Chennai, auto scenes etc.For me the surprise was Meetha... Her acting was excellent. Oh yeah forgot the acting is grandpa (director balaji) and grandma (forgot her name).Songs were good.The premise and the story setting (water distribution, water filter, IT guy and audit / accounting girl) was very refreshing., Casting Casting Casting , I didn't see an apt casting better than this for years , you cant think about any other character in place of any characters in the film, especially the lead actors Meetha Raghunath and Manikandan. 100 percentage perfection from both actors ..No one can rob directors work and the way he narrated perfectly but some how the lead actors stole the show from director. Director too will be proud for that . How many of the film crews will get awards here , if not don't worry you already won the hearts of people who watched. Simple movie for the whole family . Must watch . Don't miss it., It's definitely one of the best movies of 2023. A simple story, brilliant acting, real-life lovable character design, and decent music made it worth watching with your family.The lead actress just nailed her role. As usual, Manikandan did a fantastic job as a middle-class man. All the supporting actors played their roles very neatly. The movie is just like watching your neighbor's house through a lens. Relatable characters and a compelling story are additional pluses to the movie.Tamil cinema is elevated only by movies of this kind. Don't miss it. It has a lot of moments to connect with you personally and make you reminisce and feel nostalgic., The movie was slow and laggy at beginning. I thought this is just a normal movie which would be 5 out of 10 rating. Because saying snoring is a problem in neighbourhood is not realistic. Because snoring noise in one house wont be loud until the neighbours are hearing it. But later when the movie tried to highlight his feelings and how much he is hurt when people around him make fun of his snoring problem, the movie started to make sense. And when he is married, the problem became so realistic and well addressed. They showed how a moderate couple would handle snoring problem. And how the problem is not really a problem, there is where the movie ends with good feeling. Successful story telling, earns 10 out of 10 rating., It has a very sweet storyline, it just look like a daily life routine, watched the hindi dubbed version.It just look like your own life where there are few issues at office few small fights at home with siblings and wife and in heart every body is so attached to each other, care for each other and shows the real character of our Indian life style.Movie has love, romance with a tadka of comedy and definately lot of U turn. It shows love of wife, love of men as a brother , son and husband hidden within ego.Sweet movie a good family entertainer can be watched with family and give a strong message of accepting yourself and sacrificing for family brings real happiness., Must watch for young fellows. Understanding and mutual respect makes life beautiful.This film gives a positive note.Natural acting and natural screenplay makes the movie watchable.No masala simple and neat story line.After a long time seeing this kind of movie gives positive vibesHero and heroine selection and their acting is applaudable.No fights no unwanted songs no item song.Screenplay carries whole movie watchableThis kind of stories helps people to come down from one's stand point of view and accept the opponent's view.Overall i recommend this movie to all people, single or couple or family., Good Night is a well made feel good drama where the story revolves around man having snoring issue and how it's affecting his life . Main positive of the movie was right at the first shot it connects with audience by simply establishing middle class vibe . Characters were well written and relatable . Film was funny and laughable at same time emotional too . Cast did a great job , especially Manikandan and Ramesh Tilak combo was great . Sean Roldan music and songs were on the spot and well synced with the movie . Technically neat visuals and with good editing .Overall , nothing complicated just simple , sweet and refreshing feel good drama to watch with your family and friends . Highly recommended , kindly give it a try , I hope you like it ., Love has no meaning.But it has all feeling.Dil ta pagal he Dil dibana he.A woman can make family and a woman can also destroy it. This movie is about the 1st one.Go and watch it.Every character has their own role and they done it superbly. Comedy , love , story , acting , screenplay , dialog and most importantly it has some relatable nice pathetic scenes. Marriage is not about Mia Bibi it is about the whole family.Two mature families are tie up with great value and with rising atitude. Their mutual understanding and behaviour are good and they love each other marriage is not about husband and wife.Thank you., It creates a new category
