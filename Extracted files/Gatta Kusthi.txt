['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline. My ratings 5/10!A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values.

One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife.

Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife.

Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline. My ratings 5/10!A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline. My ratings 5/10!A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed.

Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline. My ratings 5/10!A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations.

Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline. My ratings 5/10!A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie.

The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife.

Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline. My ratings 5/10!A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist.

Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]['', One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our current society is going through.Although the end part of the film was slightly boring to a certain extent and there were a few flaws in the film as well but I'd avoid them deliberately as the pros outweigh the cons to a greater extent and get you entertained &amp; aware to a certain extent.Overall, It's a very good, promising, and positive film ever made and a must-watch for married or about-to-get married people as it talks more about the male-female/husband-wife relationship in our society/culture, which is bound to change towards equality., Gatta Kusthi was definitely interesting, comic, and touching on core values. Somehow, the screenplay felt too common and could have been approached in a more innovative wayDELICIOUS-Gatta Kusthi was very entertaining from the get-go and Karunas (playing Veera's uncle) was in part responsible for this because he went above and beyond. His chauvinistic mannerisms and comments were too funny-VIshnu Vishal and Aishwarya Lekshmi were simply fantastic
Kudos to Redin Kingsley playing the temple servant petrified by his wifeBLAND-So, the movie carried a good lesson on empowering women and teaching husbands to honor their wives, but we've seen this so many times before.It'll actually be better to see these lessons implemented in Tamil cinema rather than just preaching about it in movies because too often, female characters are marginalized-Aishwarya Lekshmi's fighting choreography could have been more robust and aggressive. The constant use of slow motion seemed to be hiding some imperfections., The plot starts with groom hunting and is a usual family drama but with sports connection. The majority of the movie revolves around the female character and the sport. The protagonist has silly expectations from the bride which helps in some good comedy and an entertaining 1st half.The 2nd half is equally good, except the villain part which was not at all needed. It seems forced just to have a wrestling fight at the end.Aiswarya Lekshmi is en-route successful female character lead movies like Nayantara, but it gets boring as most of her past films theme looks same with marriage, society and a strange husband., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., Thanks to Chella ayyavu for a quick ott release and a feel good entertainer that's cleverly scripted &amp; worthy life lessons conveyed subtlety
Vishnu Vishal should be appreciated for producing the flick despite knowing that it's about a women empowerment where regular heroic act won't be entertained...
Aishwarya lekshmi does a get a meaty role and she does at ease keeping underplayed,sometimes bold and fearless...
Munishkant and Kali venkat does strenthen the screenplay with their flawless act and special mention to karunas whose does elevate to the movie to a new level ...
Overall a perfect family entertainer makes it a must watch verdict., Despite a strong performance by Aishwarya Lekshmi this movie did not have much to offer. The movie is set in a world of male chauvinism and fake masculinity. The lead actress attempts to transcend societal barriers to prove her independence but the movie barely portrayed any of its key points properly.Disappointed with the way Vishnu Vishal is also changing into a mindless mass actor. I've enjoyed his previous hits but was cringing at his scenes in this movie. Munishkanth did not get enough screen time but his performance and Karunas were true to their roles. The comedy was bearable and at times good. Logic wise this movie lacked a lot. Was hoping this could be a gateway for future movies to have more equal roles for the lead female characters but only memes can save this movie., As per my review title, this film is an 100% propaganda film. The theme is "Women can survive without men by making many sacrifices, whereas men will be doomed without women". If this movie had been neutral, I would have given 10 stars. Because of the biased view, I give it 5 stars, that too only for good acting. Otherwise it is eligible only for 1 star. As stated by one reviewer, acting of Karunas is great. But the director made his character in such a way that even male supremists will abhor his character. Such a stereotype! Perhaps the director is from some other planet, that he is not aware of those women who kill their own children for the sake of their lovers. I don't know how long men have to bear this kind of humility, that too from fellow men., Wonderful family entertainment which clearly tells about women empowerment and respecting women dreams and their potential. Good space given to the heroine Ishwarya Lakshmi, who perfectly utilized the platform given. How the critisism is faced by the women particularly after marriage is the message in this spectacular entertainment which is targeted family audience.. all the charectors performed justifiable.. Munish Kant, Karunas did good. Hero Vishnu Vishal played well with his flawless performance. So it's an ultimate movie that pull women audience to the theatre... No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline. My ratings 5/10!A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor.

No doubt.. final verdict is - Watchable Movie!, This is an pure fiction Movie. Don't expect any logics, because you can't find one. Main plots explains the reality and requirements of women empowerment. But they totally forgot about mens and described men's as the most dumbest creatures in this world. One of the key characters karunas gave an wonderful annoying experience. No words, simply irritating. Kingsley's comedies all are really fun to watch. I can't say this is one of the best movie because it lags good screenplay, reality and logics. Vishnu vishal's come back is really appreciable and Aishwarya gave an fantastic screen time as an wrestler. Delete the climax from your mind, that was really lame. Unwanted villain, unwanted or worst writing on climax. Watch, Laugh and Forget. I personally prefer Dangal over this movie for Women empowerment., RATED 7/10

Source: NetflixI liked the movie from the beginning and the problems they touched and the character introduction are good. When the real problem pops up, the movie track into the masala path ...Big Kudos to Vishnu Vishal to produce and act in this movie, eventhough it has some negative shades in his role.I really enjoyed the first half and the second half becomes more of masala and filled with lame characters, one the example is the coach (both side coaches) By seeing the first half, the second part could have been lot better.Audience can predict the flow but in this one, we can predict the scene what next will come. The climax scene is so lame and the school kid can tell this is the scene.Good entertainer, which could have been better in lot other ways., The movie started of well. Aishwarya's role/character has been written really well. However, as a feminist, it triggered me when there were talks about gender discrimination throughout the film. It's almost the same concept in every South Indian film you know, where most of the storyline involves gender inequality. Nevertheless, my rating for this movie totally dropped during the ending, which is so poorly written. It's like they had given up on writing the storyline last minute and just made something up to wrap up the script.For very obvious reasons, this movie was not able to live up to my expectations. It does not reach up to the level of the bollywood film, Dangal or any other wrestling films; the starting did but the ending ruined the whole thing., A very average storyline! Story revolves around a lady wrestler who lies and marries to a male chauvinist. A decent family entertainer which can be easily skipped as there is no depth in the storyline.

My ratings 5/10!, I watched the movie without any expectation.Aishwarya's acting is getting better and better with every movie. Vishnuvishal done great. Music is as usual. No twist and turns but keeps us engaged until the climax of the movie. Karunas, Munishkanth, Kaali venkat all are done their part very well.Laughed loudly with almost all the comedy scenes after a longtime. Hats off to the team for brining that.If this movie ran in theaters for some more days, definitely gets more foot fall from public and got good reviews. Throwing in steaming platform very soon is not a good move.Good film for family watching., One of the most humorous films ever made, coming from Tamil Cinema after a very long time.Especially, the first half of the film was a laugh riot in theatres mostly with families watching and that too with a lower audience count.The humor is done by a serious female protagonist based on whom the entire film travels, the film might make you feel like having watched a feminism-based movie since it targets male chauvinists specifically, but it was all for humor and good things, all related to the transformation that our.

Some thoughts in this may be true but not all , this movie is only carried out because of actors and some humor. Music is not at best. One time watchable movie.But I want address some real issues in this movie that men are portrayed as guys who have many good expectations in marrying a girl, all have expectations in life because they see people growing up in a environment like girls should be like that like this... bla bla. The root cause is education we have to teach guys how to behave with girls and protect them not exploit them., The film started off well in the first half which tried to address male chauvinism and patriarchy issues. Comedy worked, acting was better. Nice character portrayal from Karunas and Munishkanth. Vishnu was good and so was Aishwarya Lakshmi. However, the issues they wanted to address is completely taken aback and they stumbled poorly in the second half by going away from the issue it tried to showcase in the beginning. It ends with a poor climax and you get a mindless masala film in the end. I was hoping for a good women oriented script when they started but ended up as a usual movie.Bright start but poor end., Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations. Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times.Could be a bit better casting, screen presence of lead roles was upto the expectations.

Karunas did his best in revealing dominance.One time watch.Some humorous, single thread message, unreality sequences makes the film both entertaining and boring at times., A stereotypical storyline, but a good, inspiring comedy entertainer for sure.As it is true that we all are living in this present world, and all are talking about equality among the rights of a boy and a girl. But even though when it comes to our home and neighborhood we can clearly see the partiality given between a girl and a boy. How it is still effecting our girls to be locked in our home as a mother, as a wife, as a daughter etc.This film is Just another story that reminds us the importance of equal rights of a girl in this society and what she can achieve and contribute with her life and success.With the on-purpose comedy and action, mannerisms 😂 they makes this film enjoyable. I'm thrilled especially with the fight sequences., Gatta Kusthi movie's view point is something thoughtful to the audience where the women is getting dominated by the men especially after the marriage life. A direction is very meaningful... No doubt for the comedy entertainment. Definitely a Humorous movie. In this society mostly the husband will be a dominant character where he can't be accepting to be dumbed before his wife. But in this case, Vishnu Vishal is acceptable to his role and executed his performance accordingly. And Aishwarya Lakshmi's role is super hardworking. Humour, music, cast and crew, required location is entertaining. Congrats to Chella Ayyavu., The movie has good sense of humor but it is lacking logic in many places and the final between hero and villan is utter non sense and complete disrespect for sports people .The villan is a trained fighter and the hero just trains himself for last 15 days and defeats the villan which is the usual plot in atleast more than 100 of Tamil movies and the pregnancy of the heroine before the fight completely shifts the expectation of the movie which is somewhat worrying considering the message it is trying to convey and the hero should have faced the heroine and it would have been more interesting to see the thought process of the director and an unusual ending to the movie. The acting by vishnu Vishal and karunas were excellent., A dialogue, if family supports girls with their dream, they will get gold medal, my question why are boys/men not getting any medals for India. Casting of Aishwarya is bad, but she tried her best, I meant only by physique as she doesn't look like a 15 trained experienced gusti player. Maybe the director consider that as comedy too. Some parts are true some are false. The villian in the movie is a typical male feminist who support woman publicly. The best actor is karunan(uncle), he is a male shovenist and most comedy come from him and main actor. Grandmother of Keerthi didn't get much space but she was very entertaining.]
